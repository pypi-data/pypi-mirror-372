napari themes for the ndev-kit, for fun

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

This plugin provides themes for napari, which can be selected in the napari settings (Preferences > Appearance). This is intended to be a fun way to test that napari plugin themes are working as expected and for learning to share this information and support users. You still may find these useful!

### Cozy Theme

A warm and cozy theme with brownish colors, intended to introduce a gray canvas for different visualizations.
