## Changelog

### 0.1.3

Fixed:
* Send a proper user agent with requests to Wikipedia [#5]


### 0.1.2

Fixed:
* Lists in fields (e.g. ccTLD "domain hacks") are parsed correctly with a
  separator added between items (`item 1, item 2` vs. `item 1item2`) [#4]


### 0.1.1

Fixed:
* English-language ICANN era gTLDs got moved to a separate page; parse that too.


### 0.1.0

First release of `sopel-tld`, based on the built-in `tld` plugin from Sopel 8.0.

Compared to the built-in plugin, this release contains a simple fix for some
ccTLD output errors caused by new `<style>` tags in the Wikipedia markup.
