# Contributing to DataPulse Core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DataPulse Core! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **üêõ Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **‚ú® Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- **üìö Documentation**: Improve docs, examples, and guides
- **üß™ Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **üîß Code**: Fix bugs, implement features, improve performance
- **üìñ Examples**: Create usage examples and tutorials

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being worked on
2. **Search discussions** to see if your question has been answered
3. **Read the documentation** to understand the current architecture
4. **Join our community** to discuss ideas and get help

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- pip or uv (recommended)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/datametronome/metronome-pulse-core.git
cd metronome-pulse-core

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
pip install uv

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=metronome_pulse_core

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m "unit"      # Unit tests only
pytest -m "integration"  # Integration tests only
pytest -m "slow"      # Slow tests only

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Unit tests (fast, isolated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Integration tests (slower, real dependencies)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conftest.py     # Shared test fixtures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_*.py       # Test modules
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Use fixtures**: Leverage pytest fixtures for common setup
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use pytest-mock for external services
- **Test edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error scenarios

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from metronome_pulse_core import Pulse, Readable

class TestPulse:
    """Test the Pulse base interface."""
    
    def test_pulse_is_abstract(self):
        """Test that Pulse cannot be instantiated directly."""
        with pytest.raises(TypeError):
            Pulse()
    
    def test_pulse_has_required_methods(self):
        """Test that Pulse has required abstract methods."""
        assert hasattr(Pulse, 'connect')
        assert hasattr(Pulse, 'disconnect')
        assert hasattr(Pulse, 'is_connected')
```

## üìù Code Style

### Formatting

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with black
black metronome_pulse_core tests

# Sort imports with isort
isort metronome_pulse_core tests

# Type checking with mypy
mypy metronome_pulse_core

# Linting with ruff
ruff check metronome_pulse_core tests
ruff check --fix metronome_pulse_core tests
```

### Style Guidelines

- **Follow PEP 8**: Use our configured tools (black, isort, ruff)
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names that follow Python conventions
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic

### Example Code

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DataConnector(Pulse, Readable, Writable):
    """Abstract base class for data connectors.
    
    This class provides a common interface for all data connectors
    in the DataPulse ecosystem.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """Initialize the data connector.
        
        Args:
            connection_string: Connection string for the data source
            **kwargs: Additional configuration options
        """
        self.connection_string = connection_string
        self.config = kwargs
        self._connection: Optional[Any] = None
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def connect(self) -> None:
        """Establish connection to the data source."""
        pass
```
