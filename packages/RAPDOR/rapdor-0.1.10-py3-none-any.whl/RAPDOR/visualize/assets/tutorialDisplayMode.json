  "Welcome to the RAPDOR tutorial. I will guide you through the webpage. I will block interactions with the page at some points. You can always leave the tutorial via close. <br> <b> Note that if something breaks just open a new broswer tab. This tool caches some values and if it breaks refreshing the page might not be sufficient.</b>",
  "Note that this tutorial is ment for the static webpage. If you are looking for the tutorial of the tool (including the data analysis) please download a local copy of it.",
  "This is the <b>analysis page</b>. Via this page you can inspect the pre-analyzed data.",
  "At the top you can find the distribution panel. Here you can control the distribution graph.",
  "Via this table you can select a distribution which is then displayed in the graph at the top.",
  "Here is the RAPDORid of the displayed distribution. Beside you can select another column from the uploaded table which is displayed in addition to the RAPDORid.",
  "This graph shows the distribution of the experimental data along the fraction dimension.",
  "You can see the distribution of the different <b>replicates via triggering the first slider</b>. The second slider is used to display raw data. Raw data is the measured data not normalized along the fraction dimension. Feel free to try the different combinations now.",
  "At the bottom of the distribution-panel is a pseudo-westernblot of the means of the raw data.",
  "Via the dropdown at the bottom you can select which columns will be displayed in the table above.",
  "Feel free to select some rows now and get familiar with the control.",
  "This is the settings panel. As you can see most of the buttons and inputs are disabled. This is because it is used in local versions in oder to analyze data via a  graphical-user-interface.",
  "Since you are looking at pre-analyzed data we will only discuss some settings. Download your own local copy of the tool if you want to learn more about how to analyze data with this GUI.",
  "The Kernel slider uses an averaging kernel along the fraction dimension. This usually reduces variance among replicates.",
  "The Distance Method is used to calculate a distance between samples from the fraction dimension. Here we used the default <b>Jensen-Shannon-Distance</b>.",
  "The samplewise distances are displayed in this heatmap. They correspond to the highlighted line in the table. Proteins with a <b>strong redistribution</b> upon treatment will have <b>lower distances between replicates</b> and <b>larger distances between treatments</b>.",
  "Since this is pre-analyzed data we can already have a look at a ranked dataset. I just sorted the dataset according to the ranks.",
  "If we look at the top ranks, you can see their samplewise distances are just as I described earlier.",
  "You can also see the change in distribution upon treatment.",
  "If you want to download this dataset you can use the Export JSON Button. This file saves the analysis and it is possible to plug it into your local RAPDOR version. If you are only interested in the table you can export it as a tsv file.",
  "You can also change the color scheme and select pre-defined schemes from the dropdown. Via clicking the colored boxes you can choose your own color scheme. We can use this, to generate nice Figures in the Figure Factory. Feel free to change it now.",
  "We now select rows to plot from the table. You can also select some more. In the next step we will visit the Figure Factory.",
  "Here is the Figure Factory. As you can see the plot contains the distributions from the selected rows. But it does not look nice yet. We can improve that.",
  "Usually the default settings are fine for plots. However, if you want to tweak some settings you need to use a local copy which enables the input fields.",
  "This is a bubble plot plot displaying all rows from the table but highlighting the selected ones. We can also find it on the analysis page. Let`s have a look.",
  "Now that we are back at the analysis page we can visit the bubble plot tab.",
  "Here you see the interactive bubble plot. If you hover over the datapoints, the corresponding distribution is shown in the distribution panel. Just try yourself.",
  "The <b>relative fraction shift</b> is an indicator of how many fractions the protein shifted. The <b>relative distribution change</b> shows whether a protein was more uniformly distributed after treatment (negative values) or accumulated in a less fractions (positive values).",
  "You can also filter this plot via a cutoff at the right. E.g. you can filter for data points with a specific Rank range. Just try yourself. First set the Cutoff Type to Rank and then use the slider to restrict the range.",
  "This is it. You finished the tutorial."
