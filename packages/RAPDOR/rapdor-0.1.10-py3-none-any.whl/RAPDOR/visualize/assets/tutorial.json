  "Welcome to the RAPDOR tutorial. I will guide you through the analysis steps. I will block interactions with the page at some points. You can always leave the tutorial via close. <br> <b> Note that if something breaks just open a new broswer tab. This tool caches some values and if it breaks refreshing the page might not be sufficient.</b>",
  "We will use data from this experiment in the tutorial: <b><a class=\"id-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" ref=\"linksrc=article_id_link&amp;article_id=10.1016/j.molcel.2019.04.018&amp;id_type=DOI\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.04.018\" data-ga-category=\"full_text\" data-ga-action=\"DOI\">      10.1016/j.molcel.2019.04.018 </a></b>. <br> The main idea is to measure the distribution of proteins along a mass related fractionation with and without RNase treatment. Proteins that show a different distribution upon treatment are so called <b>RNA-dependent Proteins</b>. Those might have interactions with RNA that are leading to a shift in measured mass once RNA is removed.",
  "However, keep in mind that this tool works for any kind of experiment with <b>two conditions</b> and a <b>multivariate measurement</b> that can be displayed as a <b>probability distribution</b>.",
  "This is the upload Page. Here you can upload your files to display.",
  "This tab is used to upload data from value seperated files. They need to follow a scheme that is described in the documentation. You can click on Docs at the top of the page and find a detailed description of that.",
  "Here you can upload pre-analyzed data from a json file.",
  "This time I uploaded the tutorial data for you. Make sure you come back to this page and upload your own data later.",
  "This is the analysis Page. Via this page you can inspect your data and run different algorithms. Our goal this time is to identify proteins that show a different distribution after RNase treatment.",
  "At the top you can find the distribution panel. Here you can control the distribution graph.",
  "Via this table you can select the proteins distribution which is then displayed in the graph at the top.",
  "Here is the RAPDORid of the displayed distribution. Beside you can select another column from the uploaded intensities table which is displayed in addition to the RAPDORid.",
  "This graph shows the distribution of your experimental data along the fraction dimension. Here you can see the distribution of the control samples compared to RNase treated samples.",
  "You can see the distribution of the different <b>replicates via triggering the first slider</b>. The second slider is used to display raw data. Raw data is the measured data not normalized along the fraction dimension. Feel free to try the different combinations now.",
  "At the bottom of the distribution-panel is a pseudo-westernblot of the means of the raw data.",
  "Via the dropdown at the bottom you can select which columns will be displayed in the table above. These columns correspond to non-data columns from your initial intensities file.",
  "Feel free to select some rows now and get familiar with the control.",
  "Because we don't want to visually inspect every line in the table to find redistributions, we need some other method to highlight them. This we can achieve using the settings panel.",
  "The Kernel slider uses an averaging kernel along the fraction dimension. This usually reduces variance among replicates and needs to be adapted according to your fractionation quality. For the tutorial, the default of three should be fine.",
  "The Distance Method is used to calculate a distance between samples from the fraction dimension.  Usually you can leave this as the <b>Jensen-Shannon-Distance</b>.",
  "The samplewise distances are displayed in this heatmap. They correspond to the highlighted line in the table. Proteins with a <b>strong redistribution</b> upon treatment will have <b>lower distances between replicates</b> and <b>larger distances between treatments</b>.",
  "The <b>Get Score</b> Button is used if you have <b>less than 5 replicates</b> per condition. It will calculate different values for each protein in the table that will help to identify distribution shifts",
  "If you have <b>5 or more replicates</b> per group you can calculate <b>p-values</b> using the <b>Run ANOSIM</b> button.",
  "Since we only have 3 replicates, I clicked the Get Score button. You can see that the Table contains all these new values now. <br>The <b>ANOSIM R</b> is an indicator for reproducible redistributions. We want to find distributions with a <b>high R</b> since they might show a shift.<br>The <b>Mean Distance</b> measures the effect size of the treatment.",
  "Thus, we will <b>rank the table</b> to find redistributions. Therefore, want to sort the table using a <b>decreasing ANOSIM R</b> and a <b>decreasing Mean Distance</b>.",
  "We need to click both triangles beside the column names two times to get a decreasing sorting. Note that this sorting will stay even if you change the page.",
  "We now applied ranks to our sorted table. Note that the order you clicked the triangles matters and reflects the way values are sorted.",
  "Now you will see proteins with a different distribution after RNase treatment at the top ranks. As you can see their samplewise distances are just as I described earlier.",
  "You can also see the change in distribution upon treatment. This protein seem to have a higher molecular weight in the control compared to the RNase treated samples.",
  "Via the Export JSON Button you can export the state of the whole analysis. Thus, you can import it later from this file, without losing information. If you are only interested in the table you can export it as a tsv file.",
  "You can also change the color scheme and select pre-defined schemes from the dropdown. Via clicking the colored boxes you can choose your own color scheme. We can use this, to generate nice Figures in the Figure Factory. Feel free to change it now.",
  "We now select rows to plot from the table. You can also select some more. In the next step we will visit the Figure Factory.",
  "Here is the Figure Factory. As you can see the plot contains the distributions from the selected rows. But it does not look nice yet. We can improve that.",
  "Usually the default settings are fine for plots. However, you can tweak some settings using the Input fields.",
  "This is a bubble plot plot displaying all rows from the table but highlighting the selected ones. We can also find it on the analysis page. Let`s have a look.",
  "Now that we are back at the analysis page we can visit the bubble plot tab.",
  "Here you see the interactive bubble plot. If you hover over the datapoints, the corresponding distribution is shown in the distribution panel. Just try yourself.",
  "The <b>relative fraction shift</b> is an indicator of how many fractions the protein shifted. The <b>relative distribution change</b> shows whether a protein was more uniformly distributed after treatment (negative values) or accumulated in a less fractions (positive values).",
  "You can also filter this plot via a cutoff at the right. E.g. you can filter for data points with a specific Rank range. Just try yourself. First set the Cutoff Type to Rank and then use the slider to restrict the range.",
  "This is it. You finished the tutorial. Now you can go to the upload page and upload your own data."
