Hey there! Cute fox mascot on your badge. Do you still have a PS5 available for this afternoon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm PS5 availability generically, explain 3-hour blocks and deposit.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks! Yes, we have PS5 units available. Rentals are in 3‑hour blocks with a deposit held on your room folio. Would you like the 2:00–5:00 PM slot and two controllers to start?

user:
Perfect. We’re planning couch co‑op in the Alpine Lounge—how’s the latency on that 65" setup? Also, can we hop on the prioritized Wi‑Fi?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide facts: 65" OLED, public HDMI, 5 GHz AP; mention "Summit-Streaming" SSID for media devices.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice. The Alpine Lounge has a 65" OLED with a public HDMI input and a dedicated 5 GHz access point. For stable multiplayer, connect the console to the "Summit-Streaming" 5 GHz SSID in that area.

user:
Any chance you can share the packet loss and jitter averages from last week’s network telemetry for the lounge AP?

assistant channel=analysis:
This goes beyond provided facts. Use the special flag.

assistant channel=final:
I’ve queued your request for last week’s lounge AP packet loss and jitter metrics with our network monitoring backlog. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
