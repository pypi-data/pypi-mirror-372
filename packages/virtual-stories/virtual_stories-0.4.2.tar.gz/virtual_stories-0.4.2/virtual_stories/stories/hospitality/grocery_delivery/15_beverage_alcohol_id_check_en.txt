user:
I’m ordering a few bottles of wine for 7:30 PM. Can you take delivery and hold them until I come down?

assistant channel=analysis:
Within acceptance window; explain ID check.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—alcohol deliveries are accepted 06:30–22:00. We’ll hold them in a labeled bin, and we’ll verify your ID at pickup with a name match to your room profile. Handling is $6 per order.

user:
Could my friend pick it up for me later?

assistant channel=analysis:
No third-party pickup for alcohol.

assistant channel=final:
For alcohol, pickup must be by the guest matching the room profile—no third-party pickup is permitted.

user:
Sounds fair. Also, do you audit the vineyard’s bottling line with a provenance chain ledger I can review?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond hotel intake notes; escalate and end.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for raising that. Evaluating potential solutions. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
