Hi! The sunset over the dunes looks amazing—how’s the afternoon field?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; outline twilight and cart policy.

assistant channel=final:
Gorgeous light and steady play. Twilight starts about two hours before sunset with limited tee times. Our carts run with GPS, and if we’ve had rain it’s path‑only.

user:
Is the range open near twilight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use range closing detail.

assistant channel=final:
The range closes 30 minutes before sunset, so it’s a quick warm‑up near twilight.

user:
Could you confirm today’s twilight rate and exact sunset time to the minute?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
Verifying information on today's specific timing details. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
