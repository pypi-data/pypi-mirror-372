Hi! Loved the lobby fireplace. If my 4 PM slot runs late, can I extend into the next block?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain consecutive blocks policy, grace period, waitlist.

assistant channel=final:
Glad the fireplace made you cozy. You can extend into the next 3‑hour block if it’s free. There’s a 10‑minute grace at the start of any booking; otherwise we offer the unit to the next guest on the waitlist.

How do I join the waitlist?

We add you in arrival order and text when a console returns. If you’re nearby, we’ll hold it for ten minutes after the SMS.
