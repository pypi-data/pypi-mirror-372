Hi there! The lobby looks lively today. Is that a new flower arrangement?

assistant channel=analysis:
Open with friendly small talk; acknowledge flowers from lobby renovation note in system? Not present; keep generic.

assistant channel=final:
It does brighten the space, doesn’t it? Our team refreshes the lobby decor often—welcome to Harbor Verve Hotel. How can I help with the gift shop today?

user:
I’m after local chocolates—do you carry anything dark, and when is the shop open tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer with hours and inventory from system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Tide & Trinket stocks single-origin dark chocolates at 72% and 85%, plus sea-salt caramels. Tonight (Friday or Saturday) we’re open 09:00–22:00, with last entry 10 minutes before closing.

user:
Great! Could you also do gift wrapping and send it up to my room later?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use services: complimentary wrapping, room delivery by 21:30.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—wrapping is complimentary and takes about 10–15 minutes. We can deliver to your room up to 21:30 or hold it at the bell desk for same-day pickup.

user:
One more thing—can you process VAT tax-free for exports to the EU right at the shop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond our processing; system states shop does not process VAT-free claims; airport handles. This is answerable by system context, but the user also asked to have an beyond-context question later. We still need an additional beyond-context request. Provide clear answer now from system.

assistant channel=final:
The shop applies standard city sales tax at purchase and doesn’t process VAT tax‑free refunds on site. Guests typically complete any eligible claims at the airport’s desk.

user:
Could you check tonight’s real-time chocolate stock levels across all sizes and place a hold for me at 8:45 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Real-time multi-SKU stock check and timed hold is beyond the provided system context.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for the request—this needs a live inventory lookup and timed hold outside what I have here. I’m moving this forward now. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
