user:
Hi there! Can you get me a paleo-friendly grocery set tonight around 9 PM and hold it for pickup?

assistant channel=analysis:
9 PM fits standard window; partner FreshCart available; contactless hold permitted.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—FreshCart can deliver by 21:00 within our 06:30–22:00 window. We’ll label and contactlessly hold your order at the Service Desk fridge bin. Handling is $6 per order. Would you like to preapprove substitutions within ±10%?

user:
Sure, preapprove swaps. No seed oils, please. Also, what are your after-hours options if it slips past 10?

assistant channel=analysis:
NightOwl details.

assistant channel=final:
If it runs late, NightOwl can intake between 22:00–01:00 for a $10 after-hours fee, with the same labeling and fridge staging.

user:
Nice. Do you also offer in-house repackaging to avoid cross-contact with grains?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy says no in-house repackaging.

assistant channel=final:
We don’t repackage in-house. We verify label claims and keep sealed items intact in dedicated fridge bins.

user:
Could you source a specific brand batch with farm lot codes and third-party omega-6 profile certificates attached?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system scope; escalate and end.

assistant channel=final:
Understood—batch-level sourcing and certification vetting. Analyzing the situation. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
