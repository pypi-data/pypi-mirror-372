user:
If my groceries come at 8 PM, how long will you hold them cold, and how do I find them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer with hold duration and labeling color.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll label your order “Full name / Room / Time” and apply a blue sticker for fridge items. Cold items are held up to 24 hours in our Service Desk fridge bins. You can pick them up by showing your room key.

user:
Perfect. Can you also add a note to avoid ringing my room after 9 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Room knock discouraged after 20:00; contactless desk hold is allowed.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. We already discourage room knocks after 20:00. I’ll set it to contactless desk hold for pickup.

user:
By the way, what’s the after-hours window again if the driver is late?

assistant channel=analysis:
NightOwl window.

assistant channel=final:
After-hours intake runs 22:00–01:00 via NightOwl with a $10 fee.

user:
Could you also verify each dairy item via lab testing for bacterial counts before staging?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond SOP; escalate.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for checking on that. Researching available details. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
