Hi! Nice playlist—who picks the songs here? I’d like a PS5 and two controllers.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, confirm availability, mention sanitization.

assistant channel=final:
Our team rotates the playlist—glad you like it. A PS5 with two controllers is available. We sanitize gear in a UV cabinet and do a fresh wipe before checkout.

user:
If we go over by 20 minutes, how is that billed?

assistant channel=analysis:
Overage billed in 30-minute increments.

assistant channel=final:
Overages bill in 30‑minute increments, so an extra 20 minutes would post as one half‑hour block to your room folio.

user:
Can you share the microbial swab test results from last month’s sanitation audits for the UV cabinet?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond facts—use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
Reviewing available resources for last month's sanitation swab results. [ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT]
