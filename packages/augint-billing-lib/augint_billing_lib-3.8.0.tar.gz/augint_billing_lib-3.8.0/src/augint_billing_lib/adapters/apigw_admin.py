"""API Gateway administration adapter implementation.

This module provides the concrete implementation of the PlanAdminPort interface,
managing API key assignments to usage plans in AWS API Gateway.

The adapter handles:
    - Moving API keys between usage plans
    - Removing keys from existing plans
    - Ensuring atomic plan transitions
    - Automatic retry logic for transient failures

Example:
    Basic plan administration::

        import boto3
        from augint_billing_lib.adapters.apigw_admin import ApiGwAdmin

        # Create adapter
        client = boto3.client('apigateway')
        admin = ApiGwAdmin(
            apigw_client=client,
            free_plan_id="plan_free_123",
            metered_plan_id="plan_metered_456"
        )

        # Move API key to metered plan
        admin.move_key_to_plan(
            api_key_id="key_abc",
            target_plan_id="plan_metered_456"
        )

Note:
    API keys can only belong to one usage plan at a time. This adapter
    ensures atomic transitions by removing from the old plan before
    adding to the new one.
