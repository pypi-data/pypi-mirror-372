"""API Gateway usage data adapter implementation.

This module provides the concrete implementation of the UsageSourcePort interface,
fetching API usage metrics from AWS API Gateway for billing purposes.

The adapter handles:
    - Retrieving usage data for specific API keys
    - Aggregating usage across multiple stages and days
    - Automatic retry logic for transient failures
    - Date range queries for usage windows

Example:
    Basic usage retrieval::

        import boto3
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta
        from augint_billing_lib.adapters.apigw_usage import ApiGwUsage

        # Create adapter
        client = boto3.client('apigateway')
        usage_adapter = ApiGwUsage(client)

        # Get usage for last hour
        now = datetime.utcnow()
        hour_ago = now - timedelta(hours=1)

        usage = usage_adapter.get_usage(
            usage_plan_id="METERED",
            api_key_id="key_123",
            since=hour_ago,
            until=now
        )

        if usage:
            print(f"API calls in last hour: {usage}")

Note:
    API Gateway aggregates usage data at the day level, so queries
    for partial days will return the full day's usage. Plan your
    reporting windows accordingly.

        Retrieves the total number of API calls made by a specific API key
        within the given time window. The API Gateway GetUsage API returns

                    print("No usage data available")

        Note:
            The API Gateway GetUsage API has these characteristics:
            - Returns data aggregated by day
            - May have a delay of up to a few minutes for recent data
            - Returns data grouped by API stage
            - Includes all HTTP methods and resources

        Warning:
            Be aware that API Gateway aggregates at the day level. If you
            query for a partial day (e.g., 10:00 to 11:00), you'll get
            the entire day's usage. Design your billing windows accordingly.
