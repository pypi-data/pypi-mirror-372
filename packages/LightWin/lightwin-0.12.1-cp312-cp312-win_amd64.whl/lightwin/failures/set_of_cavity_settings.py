            :class:`.OptimisationAlgorithm`). When it is None, every
            :class:`.CavitySettings` is taken from the :class:`.FieldMap`
            object (corresponds to run without optimisation).
        cavities :
            All the cavities that should have :class:`.CavitySettings`
            (typically, all the cavities in a sub-:class:`.ListOfElements`
            studied during an optimisation process).
        use_a_copy_for_nominal_settings :
            To create new :class:`.CavitySettings` for the cavities not already
            in ``set_of_cavity_settings``. Allows to compute quantities such as
            synchronous phase without altering the original one.
