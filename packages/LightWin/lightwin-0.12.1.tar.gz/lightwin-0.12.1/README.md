# LightWin

LightWin is a tool to automatically find compensation settings for cavity failures in linacs.

## Installation

The full installation instructions are detailed [here](https://lightwin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/installation.html).

The steps are straightforward and can be summarized as follows:

1. Create a dedicated Python environment.
2. Run `pip install lightwin`

If you want to edit the source code:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:AdrienPlacais/LightWin.git`
   > [!WARNING]
   > If you `Download ZIP` this repository (which can happen if you don't have access to `git`), installation will fail at step #3.
   > [A workaround](https://lightwin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/troubles/setuptools_error.html) is proposed in the documentation.
2. Create a dedicated Python environment.
3. From LightWin folder: `pip install -e .[test]`
4. Test that everything is working with `pytest -m "not tracewin and not implementation"`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are completely new to Python and these instructions are unclear, check [this tutorial](https://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
> In particular, you will want to:
>
> 1. [Install Python](https://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/installation/) 3.12 or higher.
> 2. [Learn to use Python environments](https://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), `pipenv` or `virtualenv`.
> 3. [Install a Python IDE](https://python-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/env/#ides) such as Spyder or VSCode.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the TraceWin module will not work out of the box.
> You will need to tell LightWin were to find your TraceWin executables.
