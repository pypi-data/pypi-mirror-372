        of a lattice that will potentially be used for compensation.
    failed :
        Second object or list of object from which you want distance. Often, a

    all_elements :

    tie_politics :
        When two elements have the same position, will you want to have the
        upstream or the downstream first?
    shift :
        Distance increase for downstream elements (``shift < 0``) or upstream
        elements (``shift > 0``). Used to have a window of compensating
        cavities which is not centered around the failed elements. The default
