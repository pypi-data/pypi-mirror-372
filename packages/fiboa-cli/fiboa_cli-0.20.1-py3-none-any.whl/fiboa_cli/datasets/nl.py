    A field block (Dutch: "Referentieperceel"), formerly known as "AAN" (Agrarisch Areaal Nederland),
    is a contiguous agricultural area surrounded by permanent boundaries, which is cultivated by one or
    more farmers with one or more crops, is fully or partially set aside or is fully or partially
    taken out of production.

    The following field block types exist:

    - Woods (Hout)
    - Agricultural area (Landbouwgrond)
    - Other (Overig)
    - Water (Water)

    We filter on "Agricultural area" in this converter.
