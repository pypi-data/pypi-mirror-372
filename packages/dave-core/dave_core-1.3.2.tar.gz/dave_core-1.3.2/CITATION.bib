    ABSTRACT = {Developing a sustainable energy system for the future requires new ways of planning and operating energy infrastructure. A large part of this involves suitable network models. Real network data is not available for research without restrictions since energy networks are part of the critical infrastructure. Using open datasets and expert rules to generate non-restricted models is one solution to this. This paper introduces open data for energy networks generated by the open-source software ``DAVE''. The Python-based data fusion tool DAVE can automatically generate customized energy network models quickly and on demand. The software collects data from various databases and uses appropriate methods to fuse them. The current version of the tool can create GIS-based power networks and gas transportation networks, with output that is compatible with common network simulation software. Further developments are planned for creating thermal and gas distribution networks, as these are important for local heat power transition. Implementing a quality description for fused datasets will also be included in future development.},
