### 2. Main Chain of Thought Process

#### Phase 1: Profile Analysis with Transparent Reasoning
```python
def analyze_linkedin_profile_with_reasoning(self, username: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Analyze LinkedIn profile with complete chain of thought transparency
    """
    with ReasoningSession(
        self.agent_id,
        f"Analyze LinkedIn profile {username} for stress factors and happiness opportunities",
        self.model_name,
        metadata={"username": username, "analysis_type": "wellness_assessment"}
    ) as session:
        
        # Step 1: Profile Data Extraction
        session.think("I need to extract comprehensive profile data to understand this person's professional context, career trajectory, and potential stress factors.")
        
        # Step 2: Stress Factor Identification
        session.think("Now I'll analyze the profile data to identify potential sources of stress based on role, industry, career changes, and work-life balance indicators.")
        
        # Step 3: Happiness Opportunity Assessment
        session.think("I'll look for opportunities to enhance happiness through career satisfaction, skill development, work-life balance, and personal fulfillment.")
        
        # Step 4: Personalized Recommendation Generation
        session.think("Based on my analysis, I'll generate specific, actionable recommendations tailored to this person's unique professional situation.")
```

#### Phase 2: Contextual Stress Analysis
```python
def identify_stress_factors_with_reasoning(self, profile_data: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Identify stress factors with transparent reasoning process
    """
    with ChainOfThought("stress_factor_identification") as cot:
        
        # Career Transition Analysis
        cot.step("Analyzing career transitions and job changes")
        cot.reason("Recent job changes can indicate career instability or growth opportunities")
        
        # Industry Pressure Assessment
        cot.step("Evaluating industry-specific stress factors")
        cot.reason("Different industries have varying stress levels and work cultures")
        
        # Role Complexity Evaluation
        cot.step("Assessing role complexity and responsibility level")
        cot.reason("Senior positions and management roles often carry higher stress loads")
        
        # Work-Life Balance Indicators
        cot.step("Examining work-life balance indicators")
        cot.reason("Location, company culture, and role demands affect personal time")
```

#### Phase 3: Happiness Enhancement Strategy
```python
def generate_happiness_suggestions_with_reasoning(self, profile_data: Dict, stress_factors: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Generate personalized happiness suggestions with transparent reasoning
    """
    with ChainOfThought("happiness_strategy_generation") as cot:
        
        # Professional Development Opportunities
        cot.step("Identifying skill development opportunities")
        cot.reason("Continuous learning and skill building enhance career satisfaction and reduce anxiety about job security")
        
        # Work-Life Balance Improvements
        cot.step("Suggesting work-life balance enhancements")
        cot.reason("Better boundaries and time management lead to reduced stress and increased personal fulfillment")
        
        # Career Alignment Assessment
        cot.step("Evaluating career-passion alignment")
        cot.reason("When work aligns with personal interests and values, job satisfaction and happiness increase significantly")
        
        # Stress Management Techniques
        cot.step("Recommending stress management strategies")
        cot.reason("Industry-specific and role-specific coping mechanisms are more effective than generic advice")

### 5. Real-Time UI Updates

#### Chain of Thought Display Components

1. **Reasoning Step Cards**
   ```python
   def display_reasoning_step(step_data: Dict):
       st.markdown(f"""
       <div class="reasoning-step">
           <h4>üß† {step_data['title']}</h4>
           <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> {step_data['reasoning']}</p>
           <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> {step_data['conclusion']}</p>
           <small>‚è∞ {step_data['timestamp']}</small>
       </div>
       """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
   ```

2. **Progress Visualization**

   ```

### 6. Example Chain of Thought Flow

#### Sample Question: "How can John Smith reduce stress and increase happiness in a sustainable way?"

**Step 1: Profile Analysis Reasoning**
- "I need to analyze John's LinkedIn profile to understand his professional context"
- "Looking at his current role as Senior Software Engineer at a fintech startup"
- "His career progression shows 3 job changes in 5 years - this could indicate growth or instability"

**Step 2: Stress Factor Identification Reasoning**
- "Fintech industry is known for high pressure and long hours"
- "Senior role likely involves technical leadership and project deadlines"
- "Recent job changes might indicate seeking better work-life balance or career growth"

**Step 3: Happiness Opportunity Assessment Reasoning**
- "His skills in Python and machine learning are highly valued - confidence booster"
- "Location in Austin suggests good tech community for networking and growth"
- "Education in Computer Science aligns well with current career path"

**Step 4: Personalized Recommendation Generation Reasoning**
- "Given his technical expertise, mentoring junior developers could provide fulfillment"
- "Fintech stress could be mitigated by setting clearer boundaries and time management"
- "His ML skills could be leveraged for side projects or speaking opportunities"
