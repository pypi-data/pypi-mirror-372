mkdir my_project
cd my_project
pixi init
pixi add --pypi jarvais
```

### (recommended) Create new conda virtual environment

```bash
conda create -n jarvais python=3.11

```

## Modules

This package consists of 3 different modules:
-  **Analyzer**: A module that analyzes and processes data, providing valuable insights for downstream tasks.
- **Trainer**: A module for training machine learning models, designed to be flexible and efficient.
- **Explainer**: A module that explains model predictions, offering interpretability and transparency in decision-making.

### Analyzer

The **Analyzer** module is designed for data visualization and exploration. It helps to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and assess relationships between different features, which is essential for building effective models.

#### Example Usage

```python
from jarvais.analyzer import Analyzer

analyzer = Analyzer(
    data, 
    output_dir="./analyzer_outputs",
    categorical_columns=['Gender', 'Disease Type', 'Treatment', 'Target'] 
    target_variable="Target", 
    task="classification"
)

analyzer.run()
```
#### Example Output

```bash
Feature Types:
  - Categorical: ['Gender', 'Disease Type', 'Treatment', 'Target']
  - Continuous: ['Age', 'Tumor Size']

Outlier Detection:
  - Outliers found in Gender: ['Male: 5 out of 1000']
  - Outliers found in Disease Type: ['Lung Cancer: 10 out of 1000']
  - No Outliers found in Treatment
  - No Outliers found in Target
```

2. **Automated Model Training**:
   - Integrates with AutoGluon for model training, selection, and optimization.
   - Handles tasks such as binary classification, multiclass classification, regression, and survival.

#### Example Usage

```python
from jarvais.trainer import TrainerSupervised

trainer = TrainerSupervised(
    output_dir="./outputs/trainer", 
    target_variable="death", 
    task="binary",
    k_folds=2
)

trainer.run(data)
```

#### Example Output
