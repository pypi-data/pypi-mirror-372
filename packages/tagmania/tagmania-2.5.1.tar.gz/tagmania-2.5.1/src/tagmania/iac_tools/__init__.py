"""Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Tools for AWS Resource Management.

This module provides the core infrastructure tools for managing AWS resources
through tag-based operations. It includes classes for cluster management,
resource filtering, and tag operations.

Core Components:
    - ClusterSet: Manages collections of EC2 instances based on cluster tags
    - TagSet: Handles tag operations on AWS resources
    - FilterSet: Manages AWS resource filtering based on tags
    - Utilities: Helper functions for AWS operations

The tools in this module provide the foundation for all cluster operations with
built-in safety limits and automation tracking to ensure only managed resources
are modified.
