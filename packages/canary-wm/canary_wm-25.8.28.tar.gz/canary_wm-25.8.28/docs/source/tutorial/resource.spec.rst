Resource pool spec
==================

Each entry in the ``resource_pool`` array is a JSON object describing that node's resources.  Each object's members are:

* ``id``: a string uniquely identifying the node; and
* arrays describing each named resource type.

On each node, each resource type is defined by an array of JSON objects whose entries describe a single instance of the specified resource.  Each instance's members are:

* ``id``: a string uniquely identifying this instance of the resource; and
* ``slots``: the number of ``slots`` of the resource available.  If not defined, the number of ``slots`` is 1.

Example
-------

A machine having 4 CPUs with one slot each and 2 GPUs with 2 slots each would be defined as:

.. code-block:: yaml

   resource_pool:
   - id: 1
     cpus:
     - id: "0"
       slots: 1
     - id: "1"
       slots: 1
     gpus:
     - id: "0"
       slots: 2
     - id: "1"
       slots: 2
