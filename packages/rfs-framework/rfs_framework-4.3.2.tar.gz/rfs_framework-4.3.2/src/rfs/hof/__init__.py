"""
RFS Higher-Order Functions (HOF) Library

A comprehensive collection of functional programming utilities for Python,
providing composable, reusable, and type-safe higher-order functions.

Modules:
    - core: Essential HOF patterns (compose, pipe, curry, partial)
    - monads: Monadic patterns (Maybe, Either, Result)
    - combinators: Function combinators (identity, constant, flip)
    - decorators: Function decorators (memoize, throttle, debounce, retry)
    - collections: Collection operations (map, filter, reduce, fold)
    - async_hof: Async HOF patterns (async_compose, async_pipe)
