### Performance Comparison vs Industry Standards

| Library | Throughput (logs/sec) | Concurrency Scaling | Async Throughput | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Kakashi (Current)** | 56,310 | **1.17x** | 169,074 | **SUPERIOR** performance |
| **Standard Library** | 18,159 | 0.59x | N/A | Python built-in |
| **Structlog** | 12,181 | 0.47x | N/A | Production ready |
| **Loguru** | 14,690 | 0.46x | N/A | Feature rich |

### Performance Analysis

- **Single-threaded Performance**: Kakashi achieves **3.1x** better throughput than standard library
- **Concurrency Scaling**: **1.17x scaling** - adding threads improves performance (industry-leading)
- **Async Performance**: **169K logs/sec** - 9.3x faster than standard library
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maintains low memory footprint across all scenarios

**Note**: These benchmarks were run on a development system and may not reflect production performance. Always test in your specific environment.

## 📖 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from kakashi import get_logger, get_async_logger

# Synchronous logging
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Application started", version="1.0.0")

# Asynchronous logging for high throughput
async_logger = get_async_logger(__name__)
async_logger.info("High-volume logging")

# Structured logging with fields
logger.info("User action", user_id=123, action="login", ip="192.168.1.1")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from kakashi import setup_environment, production_config

# Production setup
config = production_config(
    service_name="my-api",
    version="2.1.0",
    enable_async_io=True
)
setup_environment(config)
```

### Framework Integration

```python
# FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI
from kakashi import setup_logging

app = FastAPI()
setup_logging("production", service_name="fastapi-app")

# Flask
from flask import Flask
from kakashi import setup_logging

app = Flask(__name__)
setup_logging("production", service_name="flask-app")
```

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install kakashi
```

## 🧪 Performance Validation

Run the performance validation to ensure your installation meets production targets:

```bash
cd performance_tests
python validate_performance.py
```

This will test:
- Throughput performance (60K+ logs/sec)
- Concurrency scaling (0.65x+)
- Memory efficiency (<0.02MB)
- Structured logging overhead (<10%)

## 📚 API Reference
