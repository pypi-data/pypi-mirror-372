# WALLO - Writing Assistant leveraging Large Language mOdels

Often you have to write a text and forget all the helpful prompts that you used in the past. This tool helps to reduce the copy-paste from your local prompt-library and into the LLM-tools.

This program has been heavily written by Claude; at a certain point I let it just change the code.
