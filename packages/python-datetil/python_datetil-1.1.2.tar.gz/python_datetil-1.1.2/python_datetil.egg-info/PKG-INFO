# reqeusts-demo

⚠️ This is a safe educational demo simulating a typosquatting package.

## Purpose

To raise awareness about typo-based supply chain attacks (e.g., mistyping `requests` as `reqeusts`).

## What it does

- Prints a warning to the terminal
- Shows local system info (OS, username, hostname)
- Does **not** send data anywhere
