Install it:

```

Run it:
```python
from investec_python import Investec

investec = Investec(use_sandbox=True)
accounts = investec.accounts.list()

for account in accounts:
    account_balance = account.balance()
    account_transactions = account.transactions()
```

For interacting with real account data see [here](./docs/index.md#generating-the-client-credentials).

## Goals
