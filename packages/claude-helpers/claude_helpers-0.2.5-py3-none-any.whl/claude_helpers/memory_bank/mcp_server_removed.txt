# mcp_server.py removed

This file contained outdated MCP server implementation with only 5 basic tools:
- current-state
- current-progress  
- note-journal
- note-milestone
- search

All functionality has been superseded by server.py which contains 12+ advanced tools.

Removed on: 2025-08-20 to eliminate duplication and prevent confusion.
