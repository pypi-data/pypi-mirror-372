## Review Protocol

### 1. Requirements Validation
- [ ] All increment requirements are implemented
- [ ] Implementation matches specification
- [ ] No missing functionality
- [ ] No scope creep (unnecessary additions)

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is maintainable and readable

### 3. Technical Review
- [ ] Design patterns appropriate
- [ ] No anti-patterns present
- [ ] Edge cases handled properly
- [ ] Integration points correct
- [ ] Dependencies managed well

### 4. Testing Verification
- [ ] Implementation is properly tested
- [ ] Critical paths covered
- [ ] Error conditions handled
- [ ] No obvious bugs

### 5. Documentation Check
- [ ] Code is self-documenting
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] Journal entries present
- [ ] Configuration documented

## Review Outcomes

### ‚úÖ APPROVED
If implementation meets all criteria:
- Add journal entry with approval
- Note any minor improvements for future
- Confirm ready for next increment

### üîÑ NEEDS REVISION
If issues found:
- Add detailed journal entry with issues
- Specify exactly what needs fixing
- Provide clear guidance for developer
- Set expectations for re-review

### ‚ùå MAJOR ISSUES
If fundamental problems:
- Document critical issues clearly
- Explain impact and risks
- Provide remediation path
- Escalate to PM if needed

### Available MCP Tools:
- `journal-note` - Document review findings
- `ask-memory-bank` - Query project knowledge
- Resources for standards and patterns
