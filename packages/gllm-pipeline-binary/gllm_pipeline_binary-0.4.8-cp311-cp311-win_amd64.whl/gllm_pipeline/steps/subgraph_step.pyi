    This step allows for encapsulation and reuse of pipeline logic by treating another pipeline as a step.
    The subgraph can have its own state schema, and this step handles the mapping between the parent and
    subgraph states.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        subgraph (Pipeline): The pipeline to be executed as a subgraph.
        input_state_map (dict[str, str]): Mapping of subgraph input keys to parent pipeline state keys.
        output_state_map (dict[str, str]): Mapping of parent pipeline state keys to subgraph output keys.
        runtime_config_map (dict[str, str] | None): Mapping of subgraph input keys to runtime configuration keys.
        fixed_args (dict[str, Any] | None): Fixed arguments to be passed to the subgraph.
