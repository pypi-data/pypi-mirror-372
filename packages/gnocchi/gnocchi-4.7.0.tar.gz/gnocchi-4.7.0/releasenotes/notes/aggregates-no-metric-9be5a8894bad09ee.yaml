    The Dynamic Aggregates API now returns a 404 response when metrics are
    not found rather than a 400 response.  This allows differentiation between
    an invalid request to the API vs a lack of metric data due to resources
    not yet being present and is inline with the deprecated metric aggregate
    API behaviour.
