The `waveformtools.waveformtools` module is a toolkit to carryout various transformations of the waveforms. Some of its basic features include:

1. Alignment of waveforms in time, phase.
2. Normalization
3. Checking for data repetition
4. Interpolation and resampling
5. Data smootheninig.
6. Tapering.
7. Conversion to `pycbc` timeseties.
8. Check data continuity
9. Extraction of amplitudes and unwrapped phases.
