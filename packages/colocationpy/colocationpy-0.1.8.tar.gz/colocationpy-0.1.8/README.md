> A package to identify instances of co-location between mobile individuals in a
> population.

The package provides:

* **Core functionality** for detecting when and where co-location occurs.
* **Supporting metrics** for analysing the outcomes of co-location (entropy, clustering, interaction networks, modularity, etc.).
* **Transformations and utilities** to handle spatial and temporal alignment, distances, and proximity checks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install colocationpy
```

## Quickstart

Import the library and detect co-locations from mobility data, then use the built-in tools to explore the results.

Example outline:

* Provide trajectories with individual IDs, positions, and timestamps.
* Use co-location utilities to compute who was in the same place at the same time.
* Analyse the resulting interaction network or entropy measures.

## Modules

* **colocationpy (top-level)**
  Main API: co-location detection and related helpers.

* **colocationpy.metrics**
  Functions to analyse co-location results: entropies, clustering coefficient, interaction networks, mutual information, modularity.

* **colocationpy.transformations**
  Functions to align coordinate systems and map simulation timesteps to real datetimes. Used to make heterogeneous mobility data comparable.

* **colocationpy.utils**
  Distance measures, proximity functions, barrier handling, and other helpers used internally and available for advanced users.
