Spatial Filtering
=================
Spatial filters are techniques used to enhance the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) of EEG data by combining signals from multiple electrodes. 
These filters are particularly useful in BCI applications to 
improve the discriminability of brain activity patterns.
