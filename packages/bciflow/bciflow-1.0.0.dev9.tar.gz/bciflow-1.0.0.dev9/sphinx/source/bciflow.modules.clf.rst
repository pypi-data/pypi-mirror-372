Classification
=================
Classification is a critical step in the BCI pipeline, where extracted features 
are mapped to specific mental states or commands. This process involves training 
a model to recognize patterns in the data that correspond to different classes, 
such as motor imagery tasks or cognitive states. By leveraging statistical or 
machine learning techniques, classifiers enable the translation of complex 
brain signals into actionable outputs. Their effectiveness is crucial for 
ensuring accurate and reliable communication between the user and the BCI system.
