# Documentation for `airalogy`

The `airalogy` package ships with documentation in two languages:

* **English** (main reference): `docs/en`
* **Chinese** (secondary reference): `docs/zh`

To keep both audiences well-served, follow these guidelines:

1. **Primary source of truth**
   The English documentation is authoritative. Any change to the Chinese docs must faithfully reflect the English version.

2. **Update both languages together**
   Whenever you add or change a feature, edit the corresponding pages in **both** `docs/en` and `docs/zh` before merging.

3. **Pull-request checklist**
   If a PR touches documentation, confirm that:

   * English pages are updated.
   * Chinese pages are updated and synchronised with the English content.

By maintaining the two sets in lockstep, we ensure a consistent experience for users worldwide.
