Airalogy's built-in type: AiralogyMarkdown.

Airalogy Markdown (AIMD) is a Markdown-like format used in Airalogy for writing and rendering text. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to read, while also being powerful enough to support a wide range of formatting options. 

Strings of this type are parsed and rendered according to the Airalogy Markdown specification.

We explicitly refer to the format as Airalogy Markdownâ€”rather than simply Markdown, because "Markdown" is a broad term: different platforms interpret it with their own extensions and syntax rules. Without a clear label, users may be unsure which rules to follow. Declaring Airalogy Markdown as the default Markdown flavor in Airalogy makes the applicable syntax and standards unambiguous.
