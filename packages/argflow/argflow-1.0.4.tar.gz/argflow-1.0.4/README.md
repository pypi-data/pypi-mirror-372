# Argflow

**Argflow** is a fast, lightweight, and modular argument parser for Python.
It is designed as a **simpler alternative to `argparse`**, ideal for small to medium CLI scripts.


## Features

* Minimal and easy-to-use API
* Positional and optional arguments (`key=value`)
* Multiple commands support (`allow_multiple=True`)
* Modular callbacks for each argument
* Extremely fast parsing (\~200 lines of code)

## Argflow vs Argparse

> Note: `argparse` has more features, so its execution time is naturally higher.

Benchmark for a single argument:

| Parser   | Parse Time |
| -------- | ---------- |
| argparse | 0.009876 s |
| argflow  | 0.000215 s |

* **Argflow is \~98% faster** than `argparse` for parsing.
* Demonstrates how a compact library can create **powerful and fast CLIs**.

## Reliability

* Argflow is **relatively new** and still in active development.
* Suitable for personal projects and experiments, but **use with caution in critical production environments**.

## Example Usage

```python
from argflow import argflow

af = argflow()

def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

af.new_argument("hello", hello)
af.parse()
```

Command line:

```bash
python script.py --hello Alice
# Output: Hello, Alice!
```
