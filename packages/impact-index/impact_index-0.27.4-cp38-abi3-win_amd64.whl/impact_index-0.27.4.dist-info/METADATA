# Impact Index for Information Retrieval

This package is a library that implements efficient algorithms for sparse representations from neural information retrieval systems. Contrarily to other libraries, this one specifically targets neural IR models, and does not suppose any quantization. It also does not implement "standard" IR algorithms based on term frequencies.
