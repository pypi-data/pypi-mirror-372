# plaid - plot azimuthally integrated data  
plaid is a simple visualization tool intended to quickly evaluate azimuthally integrated powder diffraction data and compare to known structures, provided by the user in the form of CIF files.  
The main data format is HDF5 files, inspired by the [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) file formats.  

## Installation  
Install plaid from the Python Package Index [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) with:  
`pip install plaid-xrd`

Start the application from a terminal with:  
`plaid`

## Example  
**The main window of plaid**  
- Drag/drop an .h5 file into the main window or browse from *File* -> *Open*  
- Change the pattern by moving the horizontal lines with the mouse or the arrow keys  
- Add a new moveable line by double-clicking the heatmap, remove a line by right-clicking it  
- Click the symbols in the pattern legend to show/hide the patterns  
- Drag/drop a .cif file into the main window or browse from *File* -> *Load CIF*  
- Click on a reference line to show its reflection index  

**File tree context menu**
- Right-click on a file in the file tree to add $I_0$ or auxiliary data  
- Right-click on two or more selected files to group them  

**Export patterns**
- Save the export settings in *Export -> Export settings*
