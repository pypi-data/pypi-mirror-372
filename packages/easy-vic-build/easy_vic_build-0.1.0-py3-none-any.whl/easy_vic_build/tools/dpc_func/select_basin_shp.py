"""
Module: select_basin_shp

This module provides functions to filter and select basins from a GeoDataFrame based on various hydrological and
environmental criteria, such as streamflow data, area, aridity, and elevation slope. These functions are commonly used in
hydrological modeling and environmental research to process and refine basin-level datasets.

Functions:
----------
    - selectBasinremovingStreamflowMissing: Removes basins with missing streamflow data for a specified date range.
    - selectBasinBasedOnArea: Selects basins based on a specified area range.
    - selectBasinStreamflowWithZero: Selects basins with a significant number of zero streamflow values.
    - selectBasinBasedOnAridity: Selects basins based on an aridity threshold (yet to be implemented).
    - selectBasinBasedOnElevSlope: Selects basins based on an elevation slope threshold (yet to be implemented).

Dependencies:
-------------
    - pandas: Used for data manipulation and filtering of basin-related attributes.
    - geopandas: Handles geospatial data in GeoDataFrame format for basin selection.
    - logger: Custom logging module for tracking the filtering process.
