"""
Module: format_conversion

This module contains functions for converting raster data to shapefiles. Specifically,
it includes the `raster_to_shp` function, which reads a raster file, extracts its geometries,
and converts them into a shapefile format. This is useful for transforming raster-based data
into vector-based formats that can be more easily analyzed and visualized in GIS software.

Functions:
----------
    - raster_to_shp: Converts a raster file to a shapefile by extracting the geometries
      of raster features and saving them as vector data.

Dependencies:
-------------
    - rasterio: Provides functions for reading and processing raster data.
    - shapely: Used to create and manipulate geometries, particularly converting raster features to shapes.
    - geopandas: Provides support for handling geospatial data, specifically creating GeoDataFrames
      and writing them to shapefiles.

    Convert a raster file to a shapefile.

    This function reads a raster file, extracts its geometries (features), and saves them
    as a shapefile.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    raster_path : str
        Path to the input raster file.
    shp_path : str
        Path where the output shapefile will be saved.
    attribute_name : str, optional
        Name of the attribute field storing raster values (default="value").
    
    Returns:
    --------
    gdf : GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame containing the geometries of the features from the raster file.
