"""
Subpackage: calibrate_func

A Subpackage of easy_vic_build.tools

This subpackage contains a collection of modules that provide functions for calibration, evaluate metrics, and sampling.

Modules:
--------
    - algorithm_NSGAII: Provides functions for implementing the NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective
      optimization in model calibration. This includes setting up the optimization problem,
      evolving populations, and selecting solutions based on Pareto dominance.

    - evaluate_metrics: Contains functions to evaluate the performance of the VIC model by
      comparing simulated outputs with observed data. Various metrics like NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency),
      RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and others are provided for model evaluation.

    - sampling: Provides functions for generating sample sets used in the calibration process. This
      may include random sampling, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and other sampling techniques
      for exploring the parameter space of the VIC model.
