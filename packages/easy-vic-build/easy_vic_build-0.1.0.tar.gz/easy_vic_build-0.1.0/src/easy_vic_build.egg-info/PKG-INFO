# easy_vic_build[![easy_vic_build Logo](docs/logo_small_size.png)](https://github.com/XudongZhengSteven/easy_vic_build)

This is an open-source Python package for deploying the VIC model.  
![EVB_Architecture](docs/evb_architecture.svg)

## Installation

To install the package, run one of the following commands:

- Basic installation:

  ```bash
  pip install easy_vic_build
  ```

- For additional dependencies, choose one of the following options:
  ```bash
  pip install easy_vic_build[nco]
  pip install easy_vic_build[rvic]
  pip install easy_vic_build[nco_rvic]
  ```

Alternatively, you can install from a `.whl` file:

- Basic installation:

  ```bash
  pip install .whl
  ```

- For additional dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install .whl[nco]
  pip install .whl[rvic]
  pip install .whl[nco_rvic]

  conda install -c conda-forge gdal
  ```

Choose the appropriate installation based on your environment requirements.

For development purposes, you can install the package directly from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XudongZhengSteven/easy_vic_build
cd easy_vic_build
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the package in the following sequence:

1. **Build DPC** (`build_dpc`)
2. **Build Domain** (`build_Domain`)
3. **Build Parameters** (`build_Param`)
4. **Perform Hydroanalysis** (`build_hydroanalysis`)
5. **Build Meteorological Forcing** (`build_MeteForcing`) or (`build_MeteForcing_nco`)
6. **Build RVIC Parameters** (`build_RVIC_Param`)
7. **Build Global Parameters** (`build_GlobalParam`)
8. **Calibrate the Model** (`calibrate`)

Other
**Plot Basin Map** (`plot_Basin_map`)  
(Note: You must first run `hydroanalysis_for_basin`)
**Plot VIC Results** (`plot_VIC_result`)

## Features

- Easily deploy the VIC model with multiple configuration options.
- Integrated support for different meteorological forcing formats.
- Support for hydrological analysis and visualization of results.

## Notes

1. **RVIC Compilation Note**  
   Please note that **RVIC** should not be compiled with **VIC** if you wish to use parallel processing (e.g., `mpiexec`).

   There are two types of compilation:

   - **Compile VIC with RVIC**:  
     You can run VIC with RVIC and set different timesteps.
   - **Compile VIC without RVIC**:  
     You can run VIC in parallel, but you will need to run RVIC separately (`rvic.convolution.convolution`).  
     Make sure to prepare the `rvic.convolution.cfg` configuration file.  
     Additionally, ensure that the VIC output timestep (daily or hourly) matches the UHBOX timestep (86400 seconds for daily, 3600 seconds for hourly).

## TODO

distributed save: dpc (each component saved, a copuler can be used for combined these components into a dpc)
