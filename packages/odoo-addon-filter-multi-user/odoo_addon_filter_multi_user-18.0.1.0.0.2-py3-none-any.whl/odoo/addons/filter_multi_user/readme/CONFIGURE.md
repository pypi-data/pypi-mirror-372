To share a filter among several users you need to:

1.  Go to *Settings \> Technical \> User Interface \> User-defined
    Filters*.
2.  Edit a filter and fill the fields *Available for users* and/or
    *Available for groups* with the desired users/groups.
3.  The matched users will find the filter available as any other custom
    filter under favorites in the search panel. However only the owner
    will be able to delete the filter.
