**The first universal compiler for quantum computers based on topological principles.**

TQC moves beyond fragile gate-based quantum operations by compiling quantum algorithms into fault-tolerant braiding operations of anyonic quasiparticles. This revolutionary approach promises inherently stable quantum computation through topological protection.

## üåü Key Features

- **Topological Compilation**: Translate quantum circuits into anyonic braid operations
- **Fault Tolerance**: Inherent error protection through topological properties
- **Multiple Anyon Types**: Support for Fibonacci, Ising, and other anyonic systems
- **Advanced Simulation**: Efficient tensor network simulation of many-anyon systems
- **Optimization**: Solovay-Kitaev-style approximation algorithms for braid optimization
- **Visualization**: Generate beautiful braid diagrams and topological visualizations

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from tqc import TopologicalCompiler, FibonacciAnyons
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Create a simple quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# Compile to topological braids
compiler = TopologicalCompiler(anyon_type=FibonacciAnyons())
braid_program = compiler.compile(qc)

# Simulate the braided computation
result = braid_program.simulate(shots=1000)
print(f"Measurement results: {result.counts}")

# Visualize the braid
braid_program.visualize_braid(output="bell_state_braid.svg")
```

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Via pip
pip install topological-quantum-compiler

# Via poetry
poetry add topological-quantum-compiler

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/krish567366/TQC.git
cd TQC
poetry install
```

## üî¨ What Makes TQC Revolutionary

Traditional quantum computers suffer from:

- **Fragile qubits** sensitive to environmental noise
- **High error rates** requiring extensive error correction
- **Limited coherence times** constraining algorithm complexity

TQC solves these problems by encoding quantum information in the **topological properties** of anyonic braids, which are:

- **Naturally fault-tolerant** - protected by energy gaps
- **Stable against local perturbations** - only global changes affect computation
- **Scalable** - complexity grows polynomially with system size

## üéØ Example Applications

```python
# VQE with topological compilation
from tqc.algorithms import TopologicalVQE
from tqc.chemistry import H2Molecule

molecule = H2Molecule(bond_length=0.74)
vqe = TopologicalVQE(molecule, anyon_type="fibonacci")
energy = vqe.run()

# Quantum machine learning with anyonic features
from tqc.ml import AnyonicFeatureMap

feature_map = AnyonicFeatureMap(n_qubits=4, anyon_type="ising")
quantum_kernel = feature_map.to_kernel()
```
