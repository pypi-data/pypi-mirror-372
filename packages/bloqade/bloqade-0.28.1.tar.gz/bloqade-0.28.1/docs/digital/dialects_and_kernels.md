# Dialects and kernels

Bloqade provides a set of pre-defined dialects, with which you can write your programs and circuits.

Once you have defined your kernel, you can inspect their intermediate representation (IR), apply different optimizations using [compiler passes](../quick_start/circuits/compiler_passes/index.md), or run them on a [(simulator) device](./simulator_device/simulator_device.md).

!!! info
    A **kernel** function is a piece of code that runs on specialized hardware such as a quantum computer.

    A **dialect** is a domain-specific language (DSL) with which you can write such a kernel.
    Each dialect comes with a specific set of statements and instructions you can use in order to write your program.


When running code that targets a specialized execution environment, there are typically several layers involved.
At the surface, the programmer writes functions in a syntax that may resemble a host language (e.g., Python), but is actually expressed in a dialectâ€” a domain-specific variant with its own semantics.
A decorator marks these functions so they can be intercepted before normal host-language execution.
All dialects can be used by decorating a function.

!!! info
    Here's a short primer on decorators: a decorator in Python is simply a function (or any callable really) that takes in another function as argument and returns yet another function (callable).
    Usually, the returned function will be a modified version of the input.
    Decorators are used with the `@` syntax.


Instead of running directly, the kernel function body is parsed and translated (lowered) into an intermediate representation (IR).
This IR can be manipulated (e.g. to perform optimizations) and can later be executed by an interpreter that understands the dialect's semantics.
The interpreter uses an internal instruction set to execute the code on the intended backend, which may be a simulator, virtual machine, or physical device.
This separation lets developers write high-level, expressive code while the interpreter ensures it runs correctly in the target environment.
[QuEra's Kirin](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/) infrastructure uses this concept by defining custom dialects that are tailored towards the needs to program neutral atom quantum computers.
While the dialects are not python syntax, Kirin still uses the python interpreter to execute the code.


!!! note
    It is important to understand that when you are writing a kernel function in a dialect you are generally **not writing Python** code, even though it looks a lot like it.
    Therefore, kernel functions can usually not be called directly.
    Think of this as trying to execute another programming language with the Python interpreter: of course, that will error.


# Available dialects

Here's a quick overview of the most important available dialects.

## qasm2

There are a number of dialects with which you can write kernels that represent QASM2 programs.
See also the [qasm2 API reference](../../reference/bloqade-circuit/src/bloqade/qasm2/)

### qasm2.main

This dialect allows you to write native QASM2 programs.
As such, it includes definitions gates, measurements and quantum and classical registers, which are part of the QASM2 specification.
For details on the language, see the [specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429).

Here's an example kernel

```python
from bloqade import qasm2

@qasm2.main
def main():
    q = qasm2.qreg(2)
    qasm2.h(q[0])
    qasm2.cx(q[0], q[1])

    c = qasm2.creg(2)
    qasm2.measure(q, c)
    return c
```

Here's how you can look at the QASM2 program this kernel represents:

```python
from bloqade.qasm2.emit import QASM2
from bloqade.qasm2.parse import pprint


target = QASM2()
qasm2_program = target.emit(main)
pprint(qasm2_program)
```

### qasm2.extended

This dialect can also be used to write QASM2 programs.
However, it adds a couple of statements that makes it easier to write programs.
For example, QASM2 does not support for-loops.
With `qasm2.extended`, however, you can use for-loops and can let the compiler worry about unrolling these loops such that valid QASM2 code is produced.

```python
from bloqade import qasm2

@qasm2.extended
def main():
    n = 2
    q = qasm2.qreg(n)

    for i in range(n):
        qasm2.h(q[i])

    qasm2.cx(q[0], q[1])
    c = qasm2.creg(n)
    qasm2.measure(q, c)
    return c
```

If you run this through the code emission as shown above, you'll see that the for-loop gets unrolled into separate hadamard gate applications for each qubit.
At the same time, if you try to define this kernel using the `qasm2.main` dialect only, you will receive a `BuildError` telling you to take that crazy for-loop out of there as it's not supported.


## noise.native

Using this dialect, you can represent different noise processes in your kernel.
As of now, there are essentially two different noise channels:

* A pauli noise channel, which can represent different types of decoherence.
* An atomic loss channel, which can be used to model effects of losing a qubit during the execution of a program.

Usually, you don't want to write noise statements directly.
Instead, use a [NoisePass][bloqade.qasm2.passes.NoisePass] in order to inject noise statements automatically according to a specific noise model.

!!! note
    Right now, only the `qasm2.extended` dialect fully support noise.

For example, you may want to do something like this:

```python
from bloqade import qasm2
from bloqade.qasm2.passes import NoisePass

@qasm2.extended
def main():
    n = 2
    q = qasm2.qreg(n)

    for i in range(n):
        qasm2.h(q[i])

    qasm2.cx(q[0], q[1])
    c = qasm2.creg(n)
    qasm2.measure(q, c)
    return c

# Define the noise pass you want to use
noise_pass = NoisePass(main.dialects)  # just use the default noise model for now

# Inject the noise - note that the main method will be updated in-place
noise_pass(main)

# Look at the IR and all the glorious noise in there
main.print()
```


## squin

!!! warning
    The squin dialect is in an early stage of development.
    Expect substantial changes to it in the near future.


This dialect is, in a sense, more expressive than the qasm2 dialects: it allows you to specify operators rather than just gate applications.
That can be useful if you're trying to e.g. simulate a Hamiltonian time evolution.

For simple circuits, however, gate applications also have short-hand standard library definitions defined in the `squin.gate` submodule.
Here's a short example:

```python
from bloqade import squin

@squin.kernel
def main():
    q = squin.qubit.new(2)
    squin.gate.h(q[0])
    squin.gate.cx(q[0], q[1])
    return squin.qubit.measure(q)

# have a look at the IR
main.print()
```


As mentioned above, you can also build up more complex "operators" that are then applied to any number of qubits.
To show how you can do that, here's an example on how to write the above kernel defining the gates as separate operators.
This isn't exactly a practical use-case, but serves as an example.

```python
from bloqade import squin

@squin.kernel
def main():
    q = squin.qubit.new(2)
    h = squin.op.h()

    # apply a hadamard to only the first qubit
    h1 = squin.op.kron(h, squin.op.identity(sites=1))

    squin.qubit.apply(h1, q[0], q[1])

    cx = squin.op.cx()
    squin.qubit.apply(cx, q[0], q[1])

    return squin.qubit.measure(q)

# have a look at the IR
main.print()
```
