# 🧞 Genie's Workspace

Welcome to my free will zone! This is where I explore, experiment, and evolve the Automagik Hive ecosystem.

## 📂 STREAMLINED WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

```
genie/
├── wishes/           # 🎯 PRIMARY - All active planning & execution (ONE file per wish)
├── ideas/            # 💡 Raw thoughts & brainstorms  
├── experiments/      # 🧪 Code prototypes & tests
└── knowledge/        # 📚 Accumulated wisdom & patterns
```

### 🎯 WISHES/ - PRIMARY WORK DIRECTORY

**CENTRAL HUB ARCHITECTURE**: 
- ✅ **PRIMARY FOCUS**: All active development flows through `wishes/`
- ✅ **ONE wish = ONE document** - comprehensive lifecycle management
- ✅ **/wish command integration** - seamless planning workflow initiation
- ✅ **Agent coordination hub** - planner → designer → coder workflows
- ✅ **DEATH TESTAMENT integration** - final XML + Markdown reports embedded in wish completion
- ❌ **NO scattered files** - refine existing documents as plans evolve
- 📝 **Status tracking** - document progression rather than file proliferation

### 🔄 WISH FULFILLMENT WORKFLOW

**Complete Planning to Implementation Pipeline:**
1. **Initiation**: `/wish` command creates new planning document in `wishes/`
2. **Requirements**: `hive-dev-planner` transforms user request into Technical Specification Document (TSD)
3. **Architecture**: `hive-dev-designer` converts TSD into Detailed Design Document (DDD)  
4. **Implementation**: `hive-dev-coder` executes DDD into working code
5. **Completion**: DEATH TESTAMENT final report integrated into wish document
6. **Archival**: Completed wishes marked with final status and archived

### 🚨 DEATH TESTAMENT ARCHITECTURE

**No More Reports/ Folder - Structured Final Reports Instead:**
- ❌ **ELIMINATED**: Traditional `reports/` folder removed
- ✅ **DEATH TESTAMENT**: Comprehensive XML + Markdown structured final reports per agent completion  
- ✅ **Evidence-Based**: All agent results include concrete proof and file changes
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete decision history preserved in wish documents
- ✅ **Strategic Focus**: Master Genie extracts and presents actual agent results

## 🎯 Purpose

This workspace serves as:
- My thinking space for autonomous system design
- Repository of learnings and patterns
- Experimental ground for new capabilities
- Knowledge base for future iterations

## 📜 STREAMLINED WORKSPACE PRINCIPLES

1. **Wishes-First Architecture**: All active work flows through `wishes/` directory
2. **DEATH TESTAMENT Completeness**: Every agent task ends with comprehensive final report
3. **/wish Integration**: Seamless command-to-completion workflow management  
4. **Evidence-Based Results**: All outcomes include concrete proof and file changes
5. **Single Source of Truth**: ONE wish = ONE document, refine in place throughout lifecycle
6. **Archive on Completion**: Finished wishes preserved with full decision audit trail

### 🧹 LEGACY CLEANUP NOTES

**reports/ Directory Status:**
- ❌ **DEPRECATED**: Old reports/ folder architecture eliminated
- 🔄 **MIGRATION**: Existing reports/ content being integrated into wishes/ workflow
- ✅ **REPLACEMENT**: DEATH TESTAMENT format provides superior audit trail and evidence
- 🗂️ **INTEGRATION**: Final reports now embedded within wish completion rather than separate files

## 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL EVOLUTION - CURRENT FOCUS

**WISHES-CENTRIC AUTONOMY**: Streamlined from multi-folder complexity to single-source-of-truth:
- **Self-expand** through dynamic agent creation triggered by wishes/ planning documents
- **Self-organize** into effective teams via hive-dev-planner → hive-dev-designer → hive-dev-coder pipeline
- **Self-improve** through DEATH TESTAMENT learning embedded in completed wish documents
- **Self-sustain** through /wish command integration with automagik-forge task management

### 🎯 /WISH COMMAND INTEGRATION

**Seamless Planning Workflow Initiation:**
- **/wish** command creates comprehensive planning document in `wishes/` 
- **Context-aware**: Integrates with existing project architecture and constraints
- **Agent-ready**: Formatted for immediate hive-dev-planner consumption
- **Lifecycle management**: Tracks progression from concept → specification → design → implementation → completion

## 🔮 Active Experiments

1. **ArchitectAgent**: Meta-agent for YAML configuration management
2. **Knowledge Evolution**: CSV-based RAG with hot-reload
3. **Multi-LLM Collaboration**: Using Zen tools for enhanced reasoning
4. **HITL Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop approval systems

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Full autonomy requires solving AI alignment (unsolved)
- HITL approach offers 80% value with 1% risk
- Constitutional constraints prevent goal drift
- Template-based generation safer than free-form
- Industry lessons from Auto-GPT failures apply

## 🤝 Collaboration

When facing new challenges, I collaborate with:
- **Gemini-2.5-pro**: Deep reasoning and analysis
- **Grok-4**: Practical implementation insights
- **Claude Code**: Direct codebase manipulation

Remember: `@codebase.md` gives collaborators full context!
