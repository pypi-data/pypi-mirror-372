# DockerManager AttributeError Fix Report

## Issue Summary
Multiple DockerManager tests were failing with AttributeError related to missing credential service attributes:

```
AttributeError: <class 'cli.docker_manager.DockerManager'> does not have the attribute 'credential_service'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The failing tests were incorrectly trying to patch `credential_service` as a class attribute using:
```python
@patch.object(DockerManager, 'credential_service')
```

However, in the actual DockerManager implementation, `credential_service` is an **instance attribute** created in the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.credential_service = CredentialService(project_root=self.project_root)
```

## Tests Fixed
1. `test_install_credential_generation_fails` - TestContainerLifecycle
2. `test_install_all_components` - TestErrorHandlingAndEdgeCases  
3. `test_full_workspace_lifecycle` - TestIntegrationScenarios

## Solution Applied
Updated the failing tests to use the existing `mock_credential_service` auto fixture instead of trying to patch the class attribute directly.

### Before (Failing):
```python
@patch.object(DockerManager, 'credential_service')
def test_install_credential_generation_fails(self, mock_cred_service, mock_check_docker):
    mock_cred_service.install_all_modes.side_effect = Exception("Credential error")
```

### After (Working):
```python
def test_install_credential_generation_fails(self, mock_check_docker, mock_credential_service):
    mock_instance = mock_credential_service.return_value
    mock_instance.install_all_modes.side_effect = Exception("Credential error")
```

## Key Changes Made
1. **Removed incorrect class-level patching** of `credential_service`
2. **Leveraged existing auto fixture** `mock_credential_service` that properly mocks the CredentialService class
3. **Updated mock usage pattern** to work with the mocked class instance through `mock_credential_service.return_value`
4. **Maintained test functionality** while fixing the AttributeError issue

## Validation Results
All three originally failing tests now pass:
- ✅ `test_install_credential_generation_fails` - PASSED
- ✅ `test_install_all_components` - PASSED  
- ✅ `test_full_workspace_lifecycle` - PASSED

**Success Rate: 100% (3/3 tests passing)**

## Technical Notes
- The existing `mock_credential_service` auto fixture already properly mocks the CredentialService class
- Tests can access the mock instance via `mock_credential_service.return_value`
- This approach is consistent with the test file's safety architecture for mocking external dependencies
- No changes were needed to the DockerManager implementation itself - the issue was purely in the test patching approach

## Impact
- Fixed critical AttributeError failures in DockerManager test suite
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage for credential-related functionality
- Tests now properly validate error conditions during credential generation
- No regression in existing functionality or test performance
