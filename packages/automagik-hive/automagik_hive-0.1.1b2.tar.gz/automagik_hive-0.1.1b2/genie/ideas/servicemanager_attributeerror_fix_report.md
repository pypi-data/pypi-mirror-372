# ServiceManager AttributeError Fix Report

## Problem Summary
Multiple ServiceManager tests were failing with AttributeError exceptions related to missing `main_service` attribute:

```
AttributeError: <class 'cli.commands.service.ServiceManager'> does not have the attribute 'main_service'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the test mocking strategy. Tests were using:
```python
patch.object(ServiceManager, 'main_service')
```

This attempted to patch `main_service` as a **class attribute**, but in the actual ServiceManager implementation, `main_service` is an **instance attribute** created in `__init__`:

```python
class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self, workspace_path: Path | None = None):
        self.workspace_path = workspace_path or Path()
        self.main_service = MainService(self.workspace_path)  # Instance attribute
```

## Solution Applied
Changed the mocking approach from patching class attributes to patching instance attributes:

**Before (Broken):**
```python
with patch.object(ServiceManager, 'main_service') as mock_main:
    manager = ServiceManager()
    # This fails because main_service is not a class attribute
```

**After (Working):**
```python
manager = ServiceManager()
with patch.object(manager, 'main_service') as mock_main:
    # This works because we're patching the instance attribute
```

## Tests Fixed
Total: **15 specific failing tests** resolved

### Docker Operations (11 tests):
- `test_serve_docker_success`
- `test_serve_docker_keyboard_interrupt` 
- `test_serve_docker_exception`
- `test_stop_docker_success`
- `test_stop_docker_exception`
- `test_restart_docker_success`
- `test_restart_docker_exception`
- `test_docker_status_success`
- `test_docker_status_exception`
- `test_docker_logs_success`
- `test_docker_logs_exception`

### Environment Setup (1 test):
- `test_install_full_environment_success`

### Uninstall Operations (3 tests):
- `test_uninstall_environment_preserve_data`
- `test_uninstall_environment_wipe_data_confirmed`
- `test_uninstall_environment_eof_defaults`

### Exception Handling (1 test):
- `test_manage_service_exception_handling` - Also fixed to use proper test logic

## Verification Results
- **Before Fix**: 31 passed, 16 failed (66.0% success rate)
- **After Fix**: 47 passed, 0 failed (100.0% success rate)

All originally failing tests now pass successfully.

## Technical Learning
This fix highlights the importance of understanding Python's attribute binding:
- **Class attributes** belong to the class itself
- **Instance attributes** belong to individual instances
- Mock patching must target the correct attribute scope

The ServiceManager follows proper OOP design by using instance attributes for stateful components like `main_service`, which requires instance-level mocking in tests.
