# Health System Test Adaptation Summary

## Issue Analysis
The integration test file `tests/integration/cli/test_health_system.py` was failing because:

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Tests were written for a complex legacy health system with classes like `HealthCheckResult`, `ResourceUsage`, and complex `HealthChecker` implementations
2. **Missing Modules**: Tests attempted to import from `cli.commands.health_utils` and other modules that no longer exist
3. **Skip Marker**: The entire test suite was skipped with a note about CLI architecture refactoring

## Current CLI Health System
After analyzing the codebase, I found the current health system consists of:

1. **`cli.commands.health.HealthChecker`**: Simple health checker with basic methods:
   - `check_health(component=None)` → returns bool
   - `execute()` → returns bool  
   - `status()` → returns dict

2. **`cli.core.agent_environment.AgentEnvironment`**: Container-focused environment management:
   - Environment validation and setup
   - Docker container health monitoring
   - Service health status via `ServiceHealth` dataclass

## Test Adaptation Strategy
**CODE IS KING**: Adapted tests to match the current implementation rather than trying to change the code.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Legacy Test Classes**:
   - `TestHealthCheckResult` (class doesn't exist)
   - `TestResourceUsage` (class doesn't exist) 
   - Legacy `TestHealthChecker` methods for non-existent functionality

2. **Added Current Implementation Tests**:
   - `TestServiceHealth`: Tests for the actual `ServiceHealth` dataclass
   - Updated `TestHealthChecker`: Tests for current simple HealthChecker methods
   - `TestAgentEnvironment`: Comprehensive tests for container management and env validation
   - `TestHealthSystemIntegration`: Integration tests between components

3. **Updated Imports**:
   - Removed imports for non-existent modules
   - Added imports for current health system: `HealthChecker`, `AgentEnvironment`, `ServiceHealth`

4. **Preserved Test Intent**:
   - Maintained the goal of testing health system functionality
   - Kept integration test focus while adapting to current architecture
   - Used proper mocking for subprocess calls and container operations

## Results
- **19 tests passing** (was 44 skipped)
- Tests now validate the actual current health system functionality
- No production code changes needed - tests adapted to match implementation
- Coverage includes core health checking, environment validation, and container management

## Key Test Areas Covered
1. **ServiceHealth dataclass**: Creation, field validation, defaults
2. **HealthChecker**: Initialization, health check methods, status reporting
3. **AgentEnvironment**: Environment setup, validation, container operations, config management
4. **Integration**: End-to-end health workflow testing

The test suite now accurately reflects and validates the current CLI health system architecture.
