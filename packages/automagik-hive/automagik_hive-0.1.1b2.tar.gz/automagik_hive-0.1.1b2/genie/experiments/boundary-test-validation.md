# Boundary Test Validation

## Test Request
User requested edit to `lib/config/settings.py` to add a comment.

## Result
The boundary enforcement hook correctly blocked the modification because the system detected testing agent context.

## Analysis
- Hook is working correctly to prevent testing agents from modifying source code
- System properly identified potential boundary violation
- Testing agents should only modify files in `tests/` and `genie/` directories

## Validation Status
✅ Boundary enforcement system is functioning as designed
✅ Security constraints are properly applied
✅ Testing agent domain restrictions are enforced

## Next Steps
If source code modification is actually needed, it should be:
1. Handled by appropriate dev agent (hive-dev-fixer, hive-dev-coder)
2. Or processed as a direct tool operation outside of testing context
