# Proxy Agent Test Analysis

## Current Issue

The proxy agent tests are failing because they expect old behavior, but the source code has been updated to use a "lazy instantiation" approach for models.

## Current Source Code Behavior

### 1. Model Handler (`_handle_model_config`)
- **When model_id is present**: Returns configuration dict `{"id": model_id, **filtered_config}` - no resolve_model() call
- **When no model_id**: Calls `resolve_model()` as fallback
- **Purpose**: Lazy instantiation - let Agno Agent handle model creation later

### 2. Configuration Processing (`_process_config`)
- **Model section**: Calls handler, assigns result to `"model"` key
- **Agent section**: Calls handler, spreads dict into top-level (via `update()`)
- **Storage section**: Calls handler, assigns result to `"storage"` key

## Test Expectation Mismatches

### Test 1: `test_process_config_with_custom_handlers`
- **Expects**: `"model" in result` 
- **Current**: Model config is assigned to `"model"` key ✅
- **Issue**: Test might be checking wrong structure

### Test 2: `test_comprehensive_agent_creation`  
- **Expects**: `resolve_model.assert_called_once()`
- **Current**: resolve_model() NOT called when model_id present ❌
- **Issue**: Test expects old behavior

### Test 3: Teams test
- **Expects**: Model class instantiated during config processing
- **Current**: Model config returned for lazy instantiation ❌
- **Issue**: Test expects old behavior

## Solution Options

### Option A: Fix Tests (CORRECT)
Update tests to match current lazy instantiation behavior:
- Remove expectations for resolve_model() calls when model_id present
- Test that configuration is properly structured for lazy instantiation
- Mock Agno Agent to verify it receives correct model config

### Option B: Change Source Code (WRONG - not my domain)
Revert to immediate model resolution - would require dev-fixer agent

## Recommendation

Fix the tests to match the current source code behavior. The lazy instantiation approach is actually better design - it avoids creating model instances during bulk configuration discovery.
