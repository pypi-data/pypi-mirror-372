```markdown
## 🤝 Built by Practitioners, for Practitioners

We created Automagik Hive to solve our own frustrations at Namastex Labs. After building multi-agent systems for clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies, we were tired of:
- Rewriting the same boilerplate for every project
- "Multi-agent" tools that were just simple agents with flaky tool calling
- Prototypes that needed complete rewrites for production

So we built the framework we wished existed. Now we're sharing it with you.

**In Production:** Powering hundreds of agents for real businesses
**Battle-Tested:** From startup MVPs to enterprise-scale deployments
**Continuously Improved:** We use this daily, so we keep it working

**Our commitment:**
- ✅ Always open source (MIT license)
- ✅ Regular updates and bug fixes
- ✅ No hidden premium features
- ✅ Transparent development on GitHub

Join us in building the future of multi-agent development. Because the best tools are built by the people who actually use them.
```

```

### The Power of Deterministic Workflows
```markdown
## Deterministic Control When You Need It

While vibe coding handles 80% of use cases, sometimes you need guarantees:

### Teams vs Workflows
**Use Teams** for intelligent routing and collaboration
**Use Workflows** for deterministic, validated execution

### Real Example: Validated Order Processing
```yaml
# Chain agents like LEGO blocks with guarantees
workflow:
  name: "Order Processing"
  steps:
    - validate_input      # Ensure data is correct
    - process_payment     # With retry logic
    - parallel:           # Speed up independent tasks
        - check_inventory
        - calculate_shipping
        - verify_fraud
    - validate_output     # Confirm results
    - retry_if_failed     # Automatic recovery
```

### Why Workflows Matter
- **Deterministic Results**: Same input → same output, every time
- **Input/Output Validation**: Catch errors before they propagate
- **Automatic Retry**: Built-in recovery from transient failures
- **Parallel Performance**: Run independent steps simultaneously
- **Audit Trail**: Track every step for compliance

### Simple Yet Powerful
```python
# Start with YAML
workflow = Workflow.from_yaml("order-processing.yaml")

# Extend with Python when needed
workflow.add_validator(custom_fraud_check)
workflow.add_retry_policy(exponential_backoff)
```

Chain agents like LEGO blocks. Get predictable results.

### Advanced Workflow Example: Order Processing
```python
from agno.workflow.v2 import Workflow, Step, Parallel, Condition

# Mix agents, teams, and custom functions
workflow = Workflow(
    name="Order Processing",
    steps=[
        fraud_detection_team,           # Team for complex analysis
        Condition(                       # Conditional branching
            condition=lambda x: x.risk_score > 0.7,
            if_true=manual_review_agent,
            if_false=Parallel(           # Parallel execution
                inventory_check_agent,
                payment_processor,
                shipping_calculator
            )
        ),
        notification_sender             # Final step
    ]
)
```
```

### Progressive Examples

**Example 1: Start Simple with YAML**
```yaml
# ai/agents/support-agent/config.yaml
agent:
  name: "Customer Support Specialist"
  agent_id: "support-agent"
  
instructions: |
  You help customers with billing and account issues.
  You have access to the knowledge base.
  
knowledge_filter:
  business_unit_filter: "customer_support"
```

**Extend with Python when needed:**
```python
# ai/agents/support-agent/agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent

def get_support_agent() -> Agent:
    # Start with YAML config
    agent = Agent.from_yaml("config.yaml")
    
    # Extend with custom logic if needed
    # Full Agno API available - no restrictions!
    return agent
```

**Example 2: Intelligent Routing Team**
```yaml
# ai/teams/routing-team/config.yaml
team:
  mode: route  # Automatic routing!
  name: "Support Router"
  
members:
  - billing-specialist
  - technical-support
  - account-manager
  
instructions: |
  Route billing questions to billing-specialist
  Route technical issues to technical-support
```

**Example 3: Multi-Step Workflow**
```yaml
# ai/workflows/onboarding/config.yaml
workflow:
  name: "Customer Onboarding"
  
steps:
  - agent: data-validator
    action: "Validate customer data"
  - agent: account-creator
    action: "Create account"
  - agent: welcome-sender
    action: "Send welcome email"
```

## 🎨 Automagik Ecosystem Strategy

### Core Positioning: Hive is Complete, Ecosystem Adds Superpowers

**Hive Standalone**: Full-featured AI development through natural language
**With Ecosystem**: Transform your AI into autonomous, always-on assistants

### 🌟 The Automagik Suite - Optional Enhancements

#### Automagik Spark - Make Your AI Autonomous
When you're ready to make your agents work independently:
- **24/7 Operation**: Heartbeat monitoring keeps agents alive continuously
- **Scheduled Intelligence**: Cron jobs, intervals, event triggers
- **Background Processing**: Long-running tasks without blocking
- **Worker Management**: Health checks, auto-recovery, task queues

**Example Use Cases with Spark:**
```bash
# Native Hive creates the agent, Spark makes it autonomous
/wish create a personal assistant that manages my calendar and sends me morning briefings

# With Spark integration:
- Morning briefings run automatically at 7 AM
- System monitors check health every 5 minutes  
- Research assistants gather information overnight
- Background processors handle heavy computations
```

**Phase 1 - Strategic Planning**:
- **hive-dev-planner**: Create TSD focusing on dual-audience value + ecosystem
- **hive-dev-designer**: Design README flow with ecosystem section

**Phase 2 - Content Creation**:
- **hive-dev-coder**: Implement new README with bundle section
- **hive-testing-maker**: Create validation for all code samples

**Phase 3 - Polish**:
- **hive-quality-ruff**: Format all code examples
- **hive-claudemd**: Ensure documentation consistency

**Phase 4 - Launch**:
- **hive-qa-tester**: Validate all examples work
- **hive-release-manager**: Coordinate launch

### Success Criteria
- Readers understand Hive works standalone
- They see clear value in Spark (autonomous agents)
