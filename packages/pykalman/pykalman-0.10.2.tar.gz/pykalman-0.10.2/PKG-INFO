**the dead-simple Kalman Filter, Kalman Smoother, and EM library for Python.**

`pykalman` is a Python library for Kalman filtering and smoothing, providing efficient algorithms for state estimation in time series. It includes tools for linear dynamical systems, parameter estimation, and sequential data modeling. The library supports the Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and EM algorithm for parameter learning.

:rocket: **Version 0.10.2 out now!** [Check out the release notes here](https://github.com/pykalman/pykalman/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Install pykalman

- **Operating system**: macOS X 路 Linux 路 Windows 8.1 or higher
- **Python version**: Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- **Package managers**: [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

For a quick installation::
```bash
pip install pykalman
```

Alternatively, you can setup from source:

```bash
pip install .
```

## :zap: Usage

``` python
from pykalman import KalmanFilter
import numpy as np
kf = KalmanFilter(transition_matrices = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], observation_matrices = [[0.1, 0.5], [-0.3, 0.0]])
measurements = np.asarray([[1,0], [0,0], [0,1]])  # 3 observations
kf = kf.em(measurements, n_iter=5)
(filtered_state_means, filtered_state_covariances) = kf.filter(measurements)
(smoothed_state_means, smoothed_state_covariances) = kf.smooth(measurements)
```

Also included is support for missing measurements:

```python
from numpy import ma
measurements = ma.asarray(measurements)
measurements[1] = ma.masked   # measurement at timestep 1 is unobserved
kf = kf.em(measurements, n_iter=5)
(filtered_state_means, filtered_state_covariances) = kf.filter(measurements)
(smoothed_state_means, smoothed_state_covariances) = kf.smooth(measurements)
```

And for the non-linear dynamics via the `UnscentedKalmanFilter`:

```python
from pykalman import UnscentedKalmanFilter
ukf = UnscentedKalmanFilter(lambda x, w: x + np.sin(w), lambda x, v: x + v, transition_covariance=0.1)
(filtered_state_means, filtered_state_covariances) = ukf.filter([0, 1, 2])
(smoothed_state_means, smoothed_state_covariances) = ukf.smooth([0, 1, 2])
```

And for online state estimation:

```python
for t in range(1, 3):
    filtered_state_means[t], filtered_state_covariances[t] = \
            kf.filter_update(filtered_state_means[t-1], filtered_state_covariances[t-1], measurements[t])
```

And for numerically robust "square root" filters

```python
from pykalman.sqrt import CholeskyKalmanFilter, AdditiveUnscentedKalmanFilter
kf = CholeskyKalmanFilter(transition_matrices = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], observation_matrices = [[0.1, 0.5], [-0.3, 0.0]])
ukf = AdditiveUnscentedKalmanFilter(lambda x, w: x + np.sin(w), lambda x, v: x + v, observation_covariance=0.1)
```

## Examples
