    Added a "root_path" configuration option with a PROMETHEUS_ROOT_PATH
    environment variable override, which allows to set a root path, which gets
    prepended to the URL path section for each Prometheus API call. So for
    example when Prometheus is hosted on localhost:80/prometheus, setting the
    root_path to "prometheus" will enable the observabilityclient to send
    requests to URLs like localhost:80/prometheus/api/v1/labels.
