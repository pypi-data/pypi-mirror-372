    Modified the observabilityclient to send keystone token with each request
    only when communicating with Aetos, instead of sending it everytime, which
    could pose a security risk. This also restricts configuration
    options for connecting to Aetos to keystone endpoints only. Configuration
    for Prometheus is unchanged and can still be done through keystone
    endpoint, through a configuration file or through environment variables.
