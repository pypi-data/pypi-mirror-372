    The rbac.PromQLRbac.modify_query method now optionally allows
    for providing a list of metric names thanks to a new parameter.
    When the new parameter isn't used, the old behavior with sending
    a Prometheus API request to retrieve the metric names is used.
    When the metric names are provided, no Prometheus API request is
    done, which greatly increases performance when using the
    modify_query repeatedly, for example in loops.
