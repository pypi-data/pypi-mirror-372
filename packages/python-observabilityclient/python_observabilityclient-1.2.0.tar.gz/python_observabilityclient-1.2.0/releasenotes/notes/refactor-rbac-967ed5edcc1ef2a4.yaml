    The rbac module was refactored. The `Rbac` class was renamed to
    `PromQLRbac` and it was moved from `observabilityclient.v1.rbac` to
    `observabilityclient.rbac`. The `enrich_query` function was renamed to
    `modify_query` and the `append_rbac` function was renamed to
    `append_rbac_labels`. All "disable_rbac" logic was removed from the
    PromQLRbac. This functionality should be handled externaly from the class
    if needed. The PromQLRbac constructor now requires an instance of the
    PrometheusAPIClient instead of an instance of observabilityclient. It
    also requires an explicitly specified project id instead of trying to
    figure it out from a provided session object.
