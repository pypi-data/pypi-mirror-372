# Design Documents

## Purpose

This directory contains technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and design documents for the LLM AnyGate project. These documents serve as the authoritative source for system design decisions and technical specifications.

## Contents

Store here:
- API specifications and endpoint definitions
- System architecture diagrams and documentation
- Component design specifications
- Data models and schemas
- Integration patterns and interfaces
- Security architecture and protocols

## Naming Conventions

- `api-specification.md` - REST/GraphQL API specifications
- `architecture-overview.md` - High-level system architecture
- `component-[name]-design.md` - Specific component designs
- `schema-[type].md` - Database or data schemas
- `integration-[service].md` - Third-party integration designs

## Example Documents

### For LLM AnyGate project:
- `gateway-architecture.md` - Core gateway design and routing logic
- `provider-interface-specification.md` - Provider abstraction layer design
- `config-schema-design.md` - Configuration system architecture
- `proxy-generation-pipeline.md` - LiteLLM proxy generation design
- `authentication-flow.md` - API key management and auth design

2. Include diagrams where helpful (ASCII art or markdown-compatible)
3. Document design decisions and rationale
4. Link to related implementation files
5. Version significant design changes
