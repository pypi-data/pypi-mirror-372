# Knowledge Summaries

## Purpose

This directory contains analysis documents, consolidated findings, and knowledge summaries that capture important insights and decisions from the LLM AnyGate project. These serve as quick references for understanding complex topics and past decisions.

## Contents

Store here:
- Technology evaluation summaries
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Research findings
- Performance analysis results
- Lessons learned compilations
- Feature comparison matrices

## Naming Conventions

- `analysis-[topic].md` - Analysis documents
- `comparison-[items].md` - Comparison studies
- `evaluation-[technology].md` - Technology evaluations
- `findings-[research].md` - Research findings
- `lessons-[area].md` - Lessons learned
- `decision-[topic].md` - Decision documentation

## Example Documents

### For LLM AnyGate project:
- `analysis-provider-performance.md` - Provider speed comparisons
- `comparison-proxy-libraries.md` - LiteLLM vs alternatives
- `evaluation-rate-limiting-strategies.md` - Rate limiting approaches
- `findings-async-patterns.md` - Async implementation research
- `lessons-api-design.md` - API design learnings
- `decision-config-format.md` - Why YAML was chosen

## Types of Summaries

### Architecture Decisions
Document why specific architectural choices were made:
- Technology selections
- Design patterns chosen
- Trade-off analyses

### Performance Analysis
Capture performance testing results:
- Benchmarks
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization outcomes

### Research Findings
Consolidate research on new technologies or approaches:
- Library evaluations
- Best practice discoveries
- Industry standard reviews

### Lessons Learned
Document what worked and what didn't:
- Implementation challenges
- Successful patterns
- Mistakes to avoid

## Best Practices

1. Keep summaries concise but complete
2. Include quantitative data when available
3. Link to source materials and evidence
4. Update when new information invalidates findings
5. Make recommendations actionable
6. Cross-reference related summaries
