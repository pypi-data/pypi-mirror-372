# Development Logs

## Purpose

This directory contains chronological records of development sessions, implementation attempts, and their outcomes. These logs help track project progress, document lessons learned, and prevent repeating past mistakes.

## Contents

Store here:
- Development session records
- Implementation attempt outcomes
- Bug investigation results
- Performance optimization attempts
- Feature implementation logs
- Failed attempts with lessons learned

## Naming Conventions

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_description-outcome.md`

Outcomes:
- `-success` - Implementation completed successfully
- `-partial` - Partially completed, needs follow-up
- `-failed` - Attempt failed, document reasons
- `-blocked` - Work blocked by external factors
- `-complete` - Task fully completed

## Example Documents

### For LLM AnyGate project:
- `2024-08-26_pixi-setup-success.md` - Initial project setup with Pixi
- `2024-08-26_provider-abstraction-complete.md` - Provider interface implementation
- `2024-08-27_litellm-integration-partial.md` - Partial LiteLLM config generator
- `2024-08-27_rate-limiting-failed.md` - Failed rate limiting attempt
- `2024-08-28_docker-setup-blocked.md` - Docker setup blocked by dependencies

## Document Template

# [Session Title]

## HEADER
- **Purpose**: [What was attempted]
- **Status**: [success/partial/failed/blocked/complete]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Dependencies**: [What was needed]
- **Target**: [AI assistants, developers]

## Session Goals
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3

## Implementation Log

### [Time] - [Activity]
[What was done]

```bash
# Commands executed
```

```python
# Code written
```

**Result**: [What happened]

### [Time] - [Activity]

## Outcomes

✅ **Completed**:
- [What was successfully done]

⚠️ **Partial/Issues**:
- [What remains incomplete]

❌ **Failed**:
- [What didn't work and why]

## Lessons Learned
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Follow-up task 1
- [ ] Follow-up task 2

## Files Modified
- `src/file1.py` - [Changes made]
- `tests/file2.py` - [Changes made]
```

## Best Practices

1. Log immediately after sessions while details are fresh
2. Include both successes AND failures
3. Document error messages and stack traces
4. Note external blockers (API limits, dependencies)
5. Link to relevant commits or PRs
6. Include time estimates vs actual time spent
