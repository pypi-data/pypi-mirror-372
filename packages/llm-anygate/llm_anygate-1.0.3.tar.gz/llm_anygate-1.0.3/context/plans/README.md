# Implementation Plans

## Purpose

This directory contains strategic roadmaps, feature implementation plans, and multi-step development strategies for the LLM AnyGate project. These documents break down complex features into manageable tasks and provide clear implementation paths.

## Contents

Store here:
- Feature roadmaps and timelines
- Implementation strategies
- Architecture migration plans
- Release planning documents
- Performance improvement plans
- Refactoring strategies

## Naming Conventions

- `[feature]-roadmap.md` - Feature implementation roadmaps
- `[component]-strategy.md` - Component development strategies
- `[version]-release-plan.md` - Version release plans
- `migration-[from]-to-[to].md` - Migration plans
- `refactor-[component].md` - Refactoring plans

## Example Documents

### For LLM AnyGate project:
- `litellm-integration-roadmap.md` - Full LiteLLM integration plan
- `v1.0-release-plan.md` - First stable release planning
- `provider-plugin-strategy.md` - Plugin system for providers
- `config-validation-roadmap.md` - Configuration validation features
- `performance-optimization-plan.md` - Gateway performance improvements
- `docker-deployment-strategy.md` - Containerization approach

## Best Practices

1. Break large features into 2-week phases maximum
2. Include time estimates and buffer time
3. Identify dependencies early
4. Define clear success criteria
5. Update plans based on implementation reality
6. Link to related tasks and design documents
