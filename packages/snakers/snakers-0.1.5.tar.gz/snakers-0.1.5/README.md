## Exercise Structure

Exercises are organized in the `exercises/` directory by topic:
- `00_intro/` - Introduction and environment setup
- `01_variables/` - Variables, types, basic operations
- `02_collections/` - Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets
- `03_functions/` - Function definitions, parameters, returns
- `04_control_flow/` - Conditionals, loops, flow control
- `05_exceptions/` - Error handling and exceptions
- `06_classes/` - Object-oriented programming
- `07_functional/` - Functional programming concepts
- `08_file_io/` - File operations and data formats
- `09_modules_packages/` - Imports, packages, modules
- `10_advanced/` - Decorators, generators, advanced concepts
- `11_testing/` - Unit testing and test-driven development
- `12_concurrency/` - Threading, multiprocessing, async programming
- `13_data/` - Data processing and analysis
- `14_web/` - HTTP clients and web programming
- `15_stdlib/` - Standard library modules
- `16_project_management/` - Virtual environments, packaging, project structure
- `17_design_patterns/` - Common design patterns
- `18_regex/` - Regular expressions

Each exercise file contains:
- Learning objectives
- TODO items to complete
- Hints and tips
- Test cases

## How It Works

1. **Find TODOs**: Each exercise has `# TODO` comments marking what you need to implement
2. **Fix the code**: Replace TODOs with working Python code
3. **Pass Ruff checks**: Your code must pass Ruff linting (style, formatting, basic errors)
4. **Run successfully**: The exercise file must execute without runtime errors
5. **Progress tracking**: Completed exercises are automatically tracked

## Ruff Configuration

Snakers uses Ruff for:
- Code formatting
- Style checking (PEP 8)
- Error detection
- Import sorting
- Modern Python practices
