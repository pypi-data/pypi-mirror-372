# Snakers Solutions

This directory contains solutions to all the exercises in the Snakers project.

When you successfully complete an exercise, it will be automatically copied here as a reference solution.

## Structure

The directory structure mirrors the exercises directory:

```
solutions/
├── 01_variables/
├── 02_collections/
├── 03_functions/
...and so on
```

## How It Works

1. When you run an exercise with `python -m snakers run <exercise>`
2. If all tests pass and the linter approves your solution
3. Your solution is automatically copied to the corresponding location in this directory

You can view your solutions anytime by browsing this directory or using:

```
python -m snakers solutions list
```

To view a specific solution:

```
python -m snakers solutions show <exercise_name>
```

## Reset Solutions

To reset all solutions:

```
python -m snakers solutions reset
```
