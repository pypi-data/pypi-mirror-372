# parrygg-python

The official Python client library for the parry.gg tournament platform API. This library provides easy access to all parry.gg services using gRPC, allowing you to build applications that interact with tournaments, events, brackets, users, and more.

## Usage

### Example

For authenticated requests, include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header:

```python
import grpc
from parrygg.services.tournament_service_pb2_grpc import TournamentServiceStub
from parrygg.services.tournament_service_pb2 import GetTournamentsRequest

# Your API key from parry.gg
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

channel = grpc.secure_channel("api.parry.gg:443", grpc.ssl_channel_credentials())

tournament_service = TournamentServiceStub(channel)

metadata = [("x-api-key", API_KEY)]

request = GetTournamentsRequest()
response = tournament_service.GetTournaments(request, metadata=metadata)

print(f"Successfully retrieved {len(response.tournaments)} tournaments")
for tournament in response.tournaments:
    print(f"- {tournament.name} (ID: {tournament.id})")

channel.close()
```
