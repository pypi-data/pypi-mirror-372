class EffectivePotential(ABC):
    r"""Base class for the effective potential Veff. WallGo uses this to identify phases and their temperature dependence, 
    and computing free energies (pressures) in the two phases.
    
    Hydrodynamical routines in WallGo require the full pressure in the plasma, which in principle is :math:`p = -V_{\rm eff}(\phi)` if :math:`\phi` is a local minimum.
    One should not neglect field-independent parts of :math:`V_{\rm eff}` that still depend on temperature. These temperature-dependent terms do affect hydrodynamics.
    Hence, for example, one may *not* choose the common normalisation of :math:`V_{\rm eff}(0) = 0`, as this would eliminate these crucial terms.
    With this in mind, you should ensure that your effective potential is defined with full T-dependence included.

    The effective potential defined here is assumed to be real. That is, the
    :py:meth:`evaluate()` function is assumed to return a real value.

    The user must call :py:meth:`configureDerivatives()` before evaluating the derivatives to set
    temperature and field scales of your potential, and optionally update the effectivePotentialError attribute.
    These quantities are used to estimate the optimal step size when computing derivatives with finite
    differences. It is done by requiring that the potential error and the error from
    finite difference calculation contribute similarly to the derivative error.
    See the :py:class:`VeffDerivativeSettings` dataclass.
