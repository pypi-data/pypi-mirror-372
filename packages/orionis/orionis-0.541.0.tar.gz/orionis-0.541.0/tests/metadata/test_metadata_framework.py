        """
        Test that all required metadata constants exist and are of type `str`.

        This method iterates over a predefined list of metadata constants and checks
        that each is an instance of `str`. This ensures that the metadata values
        required by the framework are properly defined and typed.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This is a test method and does not return any value. Assertions are used
            to validate the conditions.

        Validate the structure and type of the `CLASSIFIERS` metadata constant.

        This test ensures that the `CLASSIFIERS` constant is a list of strings,
        and that each string contains at least one '::' separator, which is
        typical for Python package classifiers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self : TestMetadataFramework

        Validate the structure and contents of the `KEYWORDS` metadata constant.

        This test checks that the `KEYWORDS` constant is a list of strings, ensuring
        that each keyword is properly typed. Additionally, it verifies that the list
        contains the essential keywords "orionis" and "framework", which are required
        for accurate metadata representation.

        Parameters
        ----------

        This test checks that the `REQUIRES` constant is a list of strings, where each string
        represents a package requirement and contains the '>=' version specifier. This ensures
        that all requirements are properly typed and formatted for dependency management.

        Parameters
        ----------

        Test the behavior and return type of the `icon()` utility function.

        This test verifies that the `icon()` function returns either a string containing
        SVG data or `None` if the icon file is not found. It ensures that the function's
        output is correctly typed and handles missing resources gracefully.
