        - Dependency lifecycle management in async contexts
        - Interface-to-implementation mapping in async scenarios

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If async container operations fail, services cannot be resolved,
            service methods return invalid results, or the container instance
            fails to properly manage async dependencies.

        Notes
        -----
        This test validates the core async dependency injection functionality
        that is essential for the Orionis framework's async service architecture.
        The container must be able to resolve services using their interface
        contracts and provide properly configured instances that work correctly
        in asynchronous execution contexts.
