        Checks that all required methods are present in the ScopeManager class.

        This test verifies the existence of a predefined list of methods that are
        essential for the correct functioning of ScopeManager. The methods checked
        include initialization, item access, containment, clearing, and context
        management methods.

            and fails the test if any are missing.
