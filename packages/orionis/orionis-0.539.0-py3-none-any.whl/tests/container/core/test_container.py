        Tests the transient registration of a service in the container.

        This method verifies the following behaviors:
            - The `container.transient()` method correctly registers a transient binding from an abstract type (`ICar`) to a concrete implementation (`Car`).
            - Each call to `container.make(ICar)` returns a new instance of `Car`, confirming transient behavior.
            - The resolved instances are of the correct type (`Car`), and each instance is a distinct object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self : TestContainer

        -------

        Notes

        After the test, the registration for `ICar` is dropped from the container to clean up.
