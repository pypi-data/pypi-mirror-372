## Overview 🛠️
Welcome to **alitiq's Forecasting Service SDK**, a robust Python-based SDK that simplifies interaction with alitiq’s Solar, Wind and Load Forecast APIs. This SDK enables seamless data retrieval, measurements management, and forecasting for solar power plants, energy demand, and more. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, it supports a range of features such as pushing measurements, retrieving forecasts, and managing locations.

Before you start using the SDK, you need to obtain an API key. For the engine / load API you will receive your key and relevant information from the alitiq Team. To obtain a key for the solar power forecasting API register here: [Solar-APP](https://solar-app.alitiq.com)

This is a work in progress. We will shortly add an extensive documentation with step by step guides to use our API with python.

## Features ✨  
- **Solar Power Plant Management**:  
  Manage PV system configurations and retrieve forecasts for your solar power installations. 
- **WindPark Management**:  
  Manage WindPark configurations and retrieve forecasts for your portfolio. 
- **Load Forecasting** by alitiq Engine:  
  Fetch and manage energy load forecasts for heat, gas, and electricity demand.  
- **Pushing and Retrieving Measurements**:  
  Push new measurement data to the API and inspect historical measurement data.  
- **Robust Validation**:  
  Powered by Pydantic, ensuring data integrity for all API interactions.

## Quickstart 🚀  
Example shows how to add a new Solar PV power plant, retrieve most recent forecast and push measurements for a given location. 
```python
from datetime import datetime
from alitiq import alitiqSolarAPI, SolarPowerPlantModel, PvMeasurementForm

# Initialize the API client
solar_api = alitiqSolarAPI(api_key="your-api-key")

# Create a solar power plant location
plant = SolarPowerPlantModel(
    site_name="My Solar Plant",
    location_id="SP123",
    latitude=48.160170,
    longitude=10.55907,
    installed_power=500.0,
    installed_power_inverter=480.0,
    azimuth=180.0,
    tilt=25.0,
    temp_factor=0.03
)

response = solar_api.create_location(plant)
print("Location created:", response)

# Retrieve a forecast ( after 1-6 hours after creation available)
forecast = solar_api.get_forecast(location_id="SP123")
print(forecast)

# Post measurements 
pv_measurements = [
    PvMeasurementForm(
        location_id="SP123",
        dt=datetime(2024, 6, 10, 10).isoformat(),
        power=120.5,
        power_measure="kW",
        timezone="UTC",
        interval_in_minutes=15,
    ),
    PvMeasurementForm(
        location_id="SP123",
        dt=datetime(2024, 6, 10, 10, 15).isoformat(),
        power=90.8,
        power_measure="kW",
        timezone="UTC",
        interval_in_minutes=15,
    ),
    PvMeasurementForm(
        location_id="SP123",
        dt=datetime(2024, 6, 10, 10, 30).isoformat(),
        power=150.0,
        power_measure="kW",
        timezone="UTC",
        interval_in_minutes=15,
    ),
]

response = solar_api.post_measurements(pv_measurements)
print(response)

```

### Setup a load location


```python
from alitiq import alitiqLoadAPI, LoadLocationForm

# Example
api = alitiqLoadAPI(api_key="your-key")

location = LoadLocationForm(
    site_name="HQ Campus",
    location_id="HQ-001",
    latitude=52.52,
    longitude=13.405,
    service=Services.ELECTRICITY_LOAD,
)

resp = api.create_location(location)
print(resp)


```
