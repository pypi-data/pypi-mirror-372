------------------

1.3.0 (2025-06-04)
------------------

- merged z3c resources from package z3c.zrtresources for future development

- remove dependency to z3c.zrtresource


1.2.0 (2015-11-27)
------------------

- feature: implemented lazy package version lookup. This will ensure that we
  only lookup and apply a resource version based on package lookup if we need
  the version for extraction. Before we did that lookup on zcml directive
  processing which was slow down the server startup. This also means we will
  never lookup and apply such package based resource versions if you don't use
  the file based versioning concept at all.


1.1.3 (2015-10-05)
------------------

- feature: added custom ResorceNotFound error and error page. This allows to
  return an empty string instead of the default NotFound page including the
  page layout. There is not need to return a nice page and layout for missing
  resources.


1.1.2 (2015-09-11)
------------------

- bugfix: fix broken i18n cdn resource path extraction


1.1.1 (2015-07-19)
------------------

- bugfix: fix directory resource extraction. Make sure we use the right version
  in file name. Use the full resource traversal path in zrt-replace and not
  only the folder reference.


1.1.0 (2015-06-30)
------------------

- feature: check version before write the verisons and zrt-repalce directives
  the the related files. This prevents that the less compiler get invoked for
  nothing because fo the modified zrt-replace.less file.

- bugfix: fix i18n resource extraction


1.0.0 (2015-06-29)
------------------

- feature: added option for extract each resource with it's own version based
  on subversion or python package version. See p01.recipe.cdn version 1.0.0
  for support cdn resource extraction. Added versions and zrt headers.
  Note; the resource signature and some implementation details are not
  compatible with previous versions. Make sure your custom implementation
  provides the correct __init__ method signature if you have a custom resource
  implementation. Otherwise the package is fully compatible if you just use the
  zcml resource directives.


0.6.2 (2013-06-20)
------------------

- bugfix: fix broken i18n resource lookup


0.6.1 (2013-03-19)
------------------

- implement include zrt resource expression. This espression can get used
  to lookup and include cdn resources which is usefull for stack different
  javascript file into one single file.

- bugfix: fix broken input str zrtresource. The existing zrtresource input
  is using non raw strings whcih ends in converted backslashes. This should
  get backported to z3c.zrtresource


0.6.0 (2012-12-12)
------------------

- feature: support named resource manager. This is usefull if you register
  resources within different layers and more then one resource manager for each
  layer. If so, a resource manager can provide a name and the resource can
  provide a manager property. This makes sure that a resource will pickup the
  right resource manager registered within an inherited layer.

- bugfix: fix broken lovely.recipe download link e.g.
  Download error on svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/lovely.recipe
  unknown url type: svn -- Some packages may not be found!

- bugfix: fix broken resource manager lookup in I18nResourceFactory


0.5.0 (2012-11-16)
