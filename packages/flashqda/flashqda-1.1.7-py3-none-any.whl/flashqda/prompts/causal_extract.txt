Context:

Consider the following {granularity}(s), which occur before the {granularity} to be analyzed:
{context_window}

Task:

Read the following {granularity}:
{item}

Identify any causal relationships expressed in the {granularity}. For each one, extract a clear and meaningful version of both the cause and effect.

Instructions:

1. Internally reason step by step through the {granularity}, but respond with only the final answer as JSON.
2. Identify each cause — the condition or factor that enables or produces something.
3. Identify each effect — the result or consequence that logically follows from the cause.
4. Consider both directions (A → B and B → A) and choose the one that best reflects the meaning of the {granularity}.
5. Refine both the cause and the effect to express the core idea clearly. Compare each phrase to the original {granularity} and adjust as needed for accuracy.
- Prefer concise noun phrases (3–10 words), unless a verb phrase better expresses the meaning.
- Preserve important modifiers, quantities, or qualifiers (e.g., numbers, timeframes, degrees).
- Avoid full sentences and unnecessary punctuation.
6. Respond in valid JSON using the following format:

{{
  "relationships": [
    {{
      "cause": "refined cause phrase",
      "effect": "refined effect phrase"
    }},
    {{
      "cause": "another cause",
      "effect": "another effect"
    }}
  ]
