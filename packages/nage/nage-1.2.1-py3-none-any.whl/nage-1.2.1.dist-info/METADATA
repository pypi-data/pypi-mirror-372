## Usage

1. For the first time use, Nage will automactically create static files `MEMO`, `SETT` and `HIST` under the route `~/.nage/`.

2. Nage will ask you to provide your own api-key. You could also edit your settings(model, endpoint, api-key) in the file `~/.nage/SETT`.

3. When everything is set, you could start using Nage by just ask `nage how can I reboot my mac?`. Nage could deal with simple Q&A questions and command suggestions. Sometimes Nage will ask further information for comprehensive answers.

4. You can ask Nage to delete the history or memory mannually. If you don't clear them, Nage will automatically clear ONLY history. Memories will be clear IF AND ONLY IF asked by user.

5. English now is set to the universal language.
