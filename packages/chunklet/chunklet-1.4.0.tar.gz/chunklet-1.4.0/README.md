# ðŸ§© Chunklet (Wrapper Package)

> **Note:** This is the `chunklet` wrapper package. It ensures backward compatibility and depends on the new, actively developed `chunklet-py` package.

The `chunklet` package name on PyPI has been transitioned to a wrapper for the new `chunklet-py` package. This was done to improve online discovery and distinguish it from other projects with similar names.

## For New Users

To use Chunklet, please install the `chunklet-py` package directly:

```bash
pip install chunklet-py
```

## For Existing Users

If you are an existing user of `chunklet`, your code will continue to work as expected. When you install or update the `chunklet` package, `pip` will automatically install `chunklet-py` for you. You can continue to import the library as you always have:

```python
import chunklet
```
