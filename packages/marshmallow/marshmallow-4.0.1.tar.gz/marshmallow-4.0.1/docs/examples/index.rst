The below examples demonstrate how to use marshmallow in various contexts.
To run each example, you will need to have `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_ installed.
The examples use `PEP 723 inline metadata <https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/>`_
to declare the dependencies of each script. ``uv`` will install the
dependencies automatically when running these scripts.
