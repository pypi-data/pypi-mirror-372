ï»¿# Griddot python package

A place for all common python code

## Python terminology

- package: A collection of modules, classes, and functions that are organized in a directory hierarchy, with an `__init__.py` file at the top level.
- package: A collection of modules that is normally published to PyPI and can be installed using pip.
- module: A single file containing Python code, which can be imported into other modules or scripts.
- script: A Python file that is intended to be run directly (not just imported).
- namespace: A package without an `__init__.py` file, used when splitting one logical package across multiple directories or distributions (rare in small projects).
