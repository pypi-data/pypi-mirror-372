Feel free to fork or contribute on
<https://gitlab.com/Louson-public/personal/python-mbzero>. Issues and PR are
welcome as much as much I can support them.

### Developper Certificate of Origin

The `-s` option of `git commit` adds a `“Signed-off-by:”` line to your commit
message. There is the same requirement for contributing to the Linux
kernel. Adding such a line signifies that you, the submitter, have agreed to the
[Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org) as
follows:

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```
