*Gufo Liftbridge* is the Python asyncio Liftbridge client library. It hides complex cluster
topology management handling tasks and the internals of the gRPC as well. Client offers
following features:

* Publishing.
* Subscribing.
* Bulk publishing.
* Cursors manipulation.
* Cluster metadata fetching.
* Stream creating and destroying.
* Transparent data compression (own extension, may be not compatible with other clients).

## Installing

```
pip install gufo_liftbridge
```

## Publishing

``` python
from gufo.liftbridge.client import LiftbridgeClient

async def publish():
    async with LiftbridgeClient(["127.0.0.1:9292"]) as client:
        await client.publish(b"mybinarydata", stream="test", partition=0)
```

## Subscribing

``` python
from gufo.liftbridge.client import LiftbridgeClient

async def subscribe():
    async with LiftbridgeClient(["127.0.0.1:9292"]) as client:
        async for msg in client.subscribe("test", partition=0):
            print(f"{msg.offset}: {msg.value}")
```

## Features

* Clean async API.
* High-performance.
* Built with security in mind.
* Full Python typing support.
* Editor completion.
* Well-tested, battle-proven code.

## On Gufo Stack

This product is a part of [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] - the collaborative effort 
led by [Gufo Labs][Gufo Labs]. Our goal is to create a robust and flexible 
set of tools to create network management software and automate 
routine administration tasks.

To do this, we extract the key technologies that have proven themselves 
in the [NOC][NOC] and bring them as separate packages. Then we work on API,
performance tuning, documentation, and testing. The [NOC][NOC] uses the final result
as the external dependencies.

[Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] makes the [NOC][NOC] better, and this is our primary task. But other products
can benefit from [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] too. So we believe that our effort will make 
the other network management products better.
