    Set up GitHub Pages deployment for a stlite app.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : {"gh-actions", "manual"}, optional
        Deployment mode.
        - "gh-actions": Deploys from a branch with GitHub Actions. Mostly hands-off, though note that
          you will still need to go to your repos settings --> pages --> Github Actions so that the
          generated workflow has permission to run.
        - "manual": Deploy directly from a branch - manual github pages settings required. This will
          still generate some additional required files, but you will need to follow the provided
          instructions to get the files to build.
    use_docs : bool, optional
        If True, serve from the `docs/` folder. Otherwise serve from the repo root.
        If you have used the pack function previously to create your app file, match the option you
        used there.
        Defaults to `True` (which matches the pack function.)
    only_on_index : bool, optional
        If True, trigger deployment only when `index.html` changes.
        Ignored if mode = "manual"
        Defaults to `True`
    branch: str, optional
        Branch to use as source.
        Ignored if mode = "manual"
        Defaults to 'main'.
    root_dir: str, optional
        Determine whether to move to a different directory prior to creation of outputs.
        The function needs to know where the root (top-level) folder of your repository is in relation
        to the folder the script running the function is.
        Should only be needed if folder packing file is being run from is not the repository root
        (e.g. you have your app stored within an 'apps' folder).
        To move up one directory, pass ".."
        To move up two directories, pass "../.."
        And so on.
        Default is 'current_dir'.
    create_nojekyll: bool, optional
        Determines whether to create a .nojekyll file, which will prevent the deployed app from being
        run through post-processing steps on Github.
        Default is True.
    create_404: str, optional
        Determines whether to create a 404 file, which will ensure you are redirected in the case of
        a url path not being found. This is more common with stlite files as refreshing while on
        a subpage or trying to navigate directly to a subpage will cause an error.
        If "relative", the 404 will just try to navigate the user one level up, which should generally
        be correct unless they have arrived via a faulty URL.
        If "none", will not be created.
        If any other value, this will be treated as the absolute URL to redirect to.
        Default is "relative".

    Returns
    -------
    Path or None
        Path to created workflow file (gh-actions mode), or Path to helper instructions file (main mode).

        In both cases, a .nojekyll file will be created in the repo root and in the docs folder if it
        is present.

        In gh-actions model, a deploy.yml will be created in the .github/workflows folder, relative to
        the provided file. This folder will be created if it does not exist.
