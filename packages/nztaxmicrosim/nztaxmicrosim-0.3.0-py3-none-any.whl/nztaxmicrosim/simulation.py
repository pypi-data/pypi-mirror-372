    """
    Run a microsimulation in either static or dynamic mode.

    This function provides a unified interface for running both static and
    dynamic simulations. In static mode, the simulation is run for a single
    year. In dynamic mode, the simulation is run for a series of years, with
    the output of one year being used as the input for the next.

    Args:
        df: The input population data.
        mode: The simulation mode, either 'static' or 'dynamic'.
        year: A single year (e.g., "2023-2024") for static mode, or a list
            of years for dynamic mode.
        use_behavioural_response: If True, simulates labour supply response.
        elasticity_params: A dictionary of elasticity parameters.
        behavioural_func: The function to use for the behavioural response.

    Returns:
        For static mode, a DataFrame containing the simulation results for the
        specified year. For dynamic mode, a dictionary of DataFrames, where
        each key is a year and the value is the simulation results for that
        year.
