    Adds stream handlers to the logger if:
    1. The root logger is not configured and has no handlers
    2. AND the module logger or its parents don't have any handlers configured.

    If both of these conditions are met, it also sets the default level of the logger to INFO if the logging level is not set for the module.
    
    This means that any submodule loggers initialised after the parent will get no handlers attached, and remain with a NOTSET level, propagating all messages to the parent, which decides what to ignore and what to pass on.
    For more fine-grained control, levels can be set on the submodule level to avoid propagation of messages.

        logger_name {str} -- The name of the module to log for
