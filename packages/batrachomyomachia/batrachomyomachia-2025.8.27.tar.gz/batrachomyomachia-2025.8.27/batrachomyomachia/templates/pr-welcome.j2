# Welcome to {{sitename}}

Hi @{{username}}, and thanks for your PR. This bot helps you send your patch series to the mailing list.

Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth submission.

## Writing a Good PR Description

- If your PR has **multiple commits**, write a meaningful description. It becomes the cover letter.
- For **a single commit**, you can leave the description empty if the commit message is clear.

To CC reviewers, add to your PR description:

```text
CC: Revi Ewer <revi.ewer@example.com>, Ill Takalook <ill.takalook@example.net>
```

Avoid copy-pasting a CC list from a previous PR. Doing so may cause failure to send the emails properly.

We recommend reviewing your commit messages carefully before submitting.

## Submitting Your Patch

To submit, you must be authorized. Ask any permitted contributor to authorize you by commenting: `/allow`. This is anyone who has been `/allow`ed before.

Once allowed, comment: `/submit`

Use `/preview` to see the emails before sending. (Requires a public forge email.)

## Responding to Reviews

Watch for replies on the mailing list. If not subscribed, you can reply by:

1. Visiting [inbox.sourceware.org](https://inbox.sourceware.org)
2. Clicking `(raw)` on the email
3. Importing it into your mail client

For Gmail:

```sh
curl -g --user "<Email>:<Password>" \
  --url "imaps://imap.gmail.com/INBOX" -T /path/to/raw.txt
  ```

## Updating Your PR

1. Push new commits, rebase and force push changes to the same branch as needed
2. Update the PR description with a “Changes since vX” section
3. Comment again with: `/submit`
