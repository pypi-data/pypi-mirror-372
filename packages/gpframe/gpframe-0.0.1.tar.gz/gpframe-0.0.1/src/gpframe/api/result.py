"""
Sentinel value for missing routine results.

This module defines the constant ``NO_VALUE`` to represent the absence of a
routine return value. It is the initial value before a routine produces a result,
and it remains unchanged in the following cases:

- The routine has not yet executed
- The routine was canceled
- The routine was interrupted
- The routine raised an exception

By comparing a routine's return value with ``NO_VALUE``, callers can detect
whether the routine produced a valid result.
