"""
Unified routine execution framework with frames, events, and contexts.

gpframe wraps user-defined routines with a *frame* that provides lifecycle
management, event handling, re-execution, and shared state. The routine itself
can remain a simple function or async function, while the frame coordinates
control flow and consistency.

Key features:
    - Works generically, from simple processes to event-driven extensions
      and parallel execution control
    - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous routines
    - Synchronous routines can optionally be executed in subprocesses
      (asynchronous ones are excluded)

Execution flow:
    - on_start → routine execution → on_end → redo check (continue or finish)
    - on_cancel is called when canceled
    - on_close is always called upon termination, followed by the terminated callback

Data and error handling:
    - Results, errors, and message exchange are consolidated into an ``Outcome``
    - Exceptions from routines, frames, and event handlers are distinguished,
      and which to re-raise is controlled by ``Raises``
    - Shared data (environment, requests, event messages) is managed with
      synchronized maps to ensure consistency across contexts
    - Contexts (``ControllerContext``, ``EventContext``, ``RoutineContext``)
      provide safe and structured access during execution

Main components:
    - **Frame** — entry point that wraps and manages routines
    - **ControllerContext / EventContext / RoutineContext** — execution contexts
    - **Outcome** — holds results, errors, requests, and messages
    - **Raises** — selects which exception types to re-raise
    - **Error types** — ``FrameError``, ``TerminatedError``, ``NotTerminatedError``, etc.

gpframe provides unified control features without burdening the routine itself.
