# airflowctl

A command-line tool for interacting with Apache Airflow instances through the Airflow REST API. It offers a convenient interface for performing common operations remotely without direct access to the Airflow scheduler or webserver.

## Features

- Communicates with Airflow instances through the REST API
- Supports authentication using Airflow API tokens
- Executes commands against remote Airflow deployments
- Provides intuitive command organization with group-based structure
- Includes detailed help documentation for all commands

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later (compatible with Python >= 3.10 and < 3.13)
- Network access to an Apache Airflow instance with REST API enabled
- Keyring backend installed in operating system for secure token storage

## Usage

Access the tool from your terminal:

### Command Line

```bash
airflowctl --help
```

## Contributing

Want to help improve Apache Airflow? Check out our [contributing documentation](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst).

### Additional Contribution Guidelines

- Please ensure API is running while doing development testing.
- There are two ways to have a CLI command,
  - Auto Generated Commands
  - Implemented Commands

#### Auto Generated Commands

Auto generation of commands directly from operations methods under `airflow-ctl/src/airflowctl/api/operations.py`.
Whenever operation is mapped with proper datamodel and response model, it will be automatically added to the command.

You can check each command with `airflowctl <command> --help` to see the available options.

#### Implemented Commands

Implemented commands are the ones which are not auto generated and need to be implemented manually.
You can check the implemented commands under `airflow-ctl/src/airflowctl/clt/commands/`.
