**MLV-Lab** is a pedagogical ecosystem for exploring fundamental Artificial Intelligence concepts through visual and interactive experimentation.

Our philosophy is **"Show, don't tell"**: we move from abstract theory to concrete, visual practice, allowing enthusiasts and developers to train and observe intelligent agents right from the terminal.
