Available Arguments

Argument	Description
```
--image	Required. Path to the image file or URL to analyze
--context	Additional context information about the image
--guess	Your guess of where the image might have been taken
--output	Output file path to save the results (JSON format)
--api-key	Custom Gemini API key
```

Examples

Basic usage:

geointel --image vacation_photo.jpg

With additional context:

geointel --image vacation_photo.jpg --context "Taken during summer vacation in 2023"

With location guess:

geointel --image vacation_photo.jpg --guess "Mediterranean coast"

Saving results to a file:

geointel --image vacation_photo.jpg --output results.json

Using a custom API key:

geointel --image vacation_photo.jpg --api-key "your-api-key-here"

API Key Setup

GeoIntel uses Google's Gemini API. You can:

1. Set the API key as an environment variable: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here


2. Pass the API key directly when initializing: GeoIntel(api_key="your_key_here")


3. Use the --api-key parameter in the command line



Get your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

Python Library
```
from geointel import GeoIntel

# Initialize GeoIntel
geointel = GeoIntel()

# Analyze an image and get JSON result
result = geointel.locate(image_path="image.jpg")

# Work with the JSON data
if "error" in result:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
else:
    # Access the first location
    if "locations" in result and result["locations"]:
        location = result["locations"][0]
        print(f"Location: {location['city']}, {location['country']}")
        
        # Get Google Maps URL
        if "coordinates" in location:
            lat = location["coordinates"]["latitude"]
            lng = location["coordinates"]["longitude"]
            maps_url = f"https://www.google.com/maps?q={lat},{lng}"
```
