For the `LICENSE` file, a simple choice is the MIT License. Go to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), copy the text, and paste it into your `LICENSE` file. Remember to replace `[year]` and `[fullname]`.

### Step 5: Build Your Package

Now you're ready to create the distribution files that will be uploaded to PyPI.

1.  **Install build tools:**
    ```bash
    pip install build twine
    ```
    *   `build` is the tool that builds your package.
    *   `twine` is the tool that securely uploads it.

2.  **Run the build command:**
    In your project's root directory (`simple-db-connector/`), run:
    ```bash
    python -m build
    ```

You will see a lot of output, and two new folders will be created: `build/` and `dist/`. The `dist/` folder contains your package files ready for distribution:
*   `simple_db_connector_lib-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (a wheel file, the modern format)
*   `simple-db-connector-lib-0.1.0.tar.gz` (a source archive, for fallback)

### Step 6: Deploy to PyPI

This is the final step! We will first upload to TestPyPI (a test server) to make sure everything works, then to the real PyPI.

1.  **Create Accounts:**
    *   Go to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account.
    *   Go to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account. **Use a different password.**

2.  **Upload to TestPyPI:**
    This is a sandbox for testing your package deployment.
    ```bash
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
    ```
    Twine will prompt you for your TestPyPI username and password.

3.  **Test Your Package from TestPyPI:**
    Create a new virtual environment and try to install your package from the test server.
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a new virtual environment
    python -m venv testenv
    source testenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: testenv\Scripts\activate

    # Install from TestPyPI
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps simple-db-connector-lib
    ```
    Now, run a Python script to test if the import works. If it does, your package is correctly built!

4.  **Upload to Real PyPI:**
    Once you're confident it works, upload it to the official PyPI.
    ```bash
    twine upload dist/*
    ```
    This time, enter your official PyPI username and password.

**Congratulations!** Your library is now live on PyPI. Anyone in the world can install it by running:

```bash
pip install simple-db-connector-lib
