    Top-level help command for kash. Get help on any kash command or action
    or a shell command (uses TLDR docs).

    Invoked by itself without arguments, `help` shows the manual (same as
    `manual`).

    With a query argument, it tries to look up help on that
    command or action or shell command, based on kash docs and TLDR docs
    (same as `explain`).

    If those fails, it sends the request to the assistant.

    You can use the `search` option to do a simple search of help docs
    and TLDR snippets.

    Note that if you want Python `help()` and not kash help, use the
    alias `pyhelp`.
