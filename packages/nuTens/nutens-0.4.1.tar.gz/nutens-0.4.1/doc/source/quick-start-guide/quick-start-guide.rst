This guide is intended to teach you the basics of using nuTens. 
By the end of it, you should have all the tools you need to start oscillating some neutrinos, and integrating nuTens into your projects.
It will cover the usage of both the c++ and python interfaces, and any significant differences between the two will be highlighted.

For more advanced usage and concepts, see the :ref:`user-manual`
