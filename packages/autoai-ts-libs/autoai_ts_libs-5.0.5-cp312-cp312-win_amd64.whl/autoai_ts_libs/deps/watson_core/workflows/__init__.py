"""The `workflows` within the `watson_core` library are essentially "super blocks" -- blocks
that call other blocks and compose an execution graph that describes how the output of one
block feeds into another block. Each `workflow` adheres to a contract that extends the contract
of a block, offering `.__init__()`, `.load()`, `.run()`, `.save()`, and `.train()` methods.
