Extralit is an open-source platform that transforms how researchers extract structured data from scientific literature. Want to get started? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.extralit.ai/latest/).

## Why use Extralit?

### Accelerate Scientific Data Collection

Manual data extraction from research papers is slow and error-prone, often taking 6-12 months for systematic reviews. Extralit combines AI-powered extraction with human validation to reduce this to weeks while maintaining research-grade accuracy.

### Take Control of Your Research Data

Most scientific data extraction tools are inflexible black boxes. Extralit is different - it's open source and puts you in control. Define custom extraction schemas, validate results, and integrate with your existing research workflows.

### Scale Your Literature Reviews

Whether you're conducting a systematic review, meta-analysis, or building a scientific knowledge base, Extralit helps you efficiently process hundreds of papers. Our platform handles complex tables, figures, and relationships while preserving scientific rigor.

## üèòÔ∏è Community

We're an open-source project built for researchers, by researchers. Here's how to get involved:

- [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/extralit/shared_invite/zt-2kt8t12r7-uFj0bZ5SPAOhRFkxP7ZQaQ): Connect with other researchers and developers
- [Documentation](https://docs.extralit.ai): Learn how to use and contribute to Extralit
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/extralit/projects/1/views/1): See what we're building and share your ideas

## Real-World Impact

Extralit is already accelerating research at leading institutions:

- **Gates Foundation**: Reduced systematic review time for malaria intervention studies from 6 months to 6 weeks
- **Life Science Research**: Streamlined extraction of clinical trial endpoints, genetic markers, and intervention protocols
- **Meta-Analysis**: Enabled rapid synthesis of evidence across hundreds of papers while maintaining rigorous validation

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Installation

Install Extralit using pip:

```console
pip install extralit
```

Initialize the client:

```python
import extralit as ex

client = ex.Extralit(
    api_url="https://your-deployment-url",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
```
