MSA Pipeline Package

Clean 5-stage MSA pipeline architecture:
1. Knowledge Extraction Stage - Extract domain knowledge from LLM
2. Model Specification Stage - Define probabilistic model structure
3. Model Synthesis Stage - Generate executable probabilistic programs
4. Probabilistic Inference Stage - Run inference and sampling
5. Result Integration Stage - Synthesize results with confidence metrics
