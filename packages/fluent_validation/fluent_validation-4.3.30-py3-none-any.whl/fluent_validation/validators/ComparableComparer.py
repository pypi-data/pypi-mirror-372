class IComparer[T](ABC):
    """
    Summary:
                    Compares the current instance with another object of the same type and returns
                    an integer that indicates whether the current instance precedes, follows, or
                    occurs in the same position in the sort order as the other object.

    Parameters:
    other:
                    An object to compare with this instance.

    Returns:
                    A value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared. The
                    return value has these meanings:

                    Value			 	Meaning
                    -----				-------
                    
                    Less than zero 		This instance precedes other in the sort order.
                    Zero 				This instance occurs in the same position in the sort order as other.
                    Greater than zero 	This instance follows other in the sort order.
