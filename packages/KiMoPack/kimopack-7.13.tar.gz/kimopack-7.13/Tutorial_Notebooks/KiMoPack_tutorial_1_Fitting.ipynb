Extensive photophysical studies revealed that the subsequent excited state dynamics is determined by the polarity and hydrogen bond donor ability of the surrounding solvent molecules. It was found that long-lived emissive states are populated in polar aprotic solvents. However, this emission switches *off* when the molecules interact with water.

It a first fast process excited states with excess electron density on both, the phen and phz sphere of the dppz ligand are populated by intersystem crossing, vibrational cooling and inter ligand hopping.

Thus, also the excited state dynamics of **Ru-dppz** in H$_2$O can be described with three kinetic parameters (```k0```, ```k1``` and ```k2```), that are added to the parameters object. In contrast to the initial guesses in ACN solution, ```k3```is optimized during the fit and initially set to 2.1 ns. "

This formation of a long-lived long-lived $^3$MLCT$_{phen}$ state is manifested, *i.e.*, in the spectral changes at 340 and 580 nm, which can be quantitatively described by two characteristic time-constants: the first one associated with  intersystem crossing, vibrational cooling and interligand hopping and a second one attributed to the non-radiative decay of a subset of $^3$MLCT states with excess electron density on the phenazine sphere of the dppz ligand ($^3$MLCT$_{phz}$), ultimately populating the long-lived $^3$MLCT$_{phen}$ state.

    "In the sequential model initially one component is excited and irreversibly decays forming a second component. Subsequently this component irreversibly decays populating a second component. this consecutive decay repeats over multiple states (in this example three states). Like in the parallel model, the TA signals are described by the product of a concentration matrix of three species and their respective spectral weights. The latter are called species associated spectra. Each j-th SAS is a combination of the j-th and the following decay associated spectrum. Thus, the final species associated spectrum is direct proportional to the final decay associated spectrum.\n",
