= Custom `classifiers`

Like in any python library you can add custom classifier to your package.
Inpired by the one in manifestoo, some are automatically added when the Odoo version is detected (See xref:odoo_version.adoc[]).

[NOTE]
====
- Programming Language :: Python
- Framework :: Odoo
- If Odoo series is defined `Framework :: Odoo :: <odoo_series>` is added to.

NOTE: If you don't set the `[project]` in your `pyproject.toml` then the `[tool.addon-odoo-wheel]` will be used.
