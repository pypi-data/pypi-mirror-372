    Instructions that the reranker references when ranking documents, after

    document type, source, and metadata, and it can generalize to other instructions
    as well. For instructions related to recency and timeframe, specify the
    timeframe (e.g., instead of saying "this year") because the reranker doesn't
    know the current date. Example: "Prioritize internal sales documents over market
    analysis reports. More recent documents should be weighted higher. Enterprise
