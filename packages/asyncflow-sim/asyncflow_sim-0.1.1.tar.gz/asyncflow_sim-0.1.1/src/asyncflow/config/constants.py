"""
Application-wide constants and configuration values.

This module groups all the static enumerations used by the AsyncFlow backend
so that:

 JSON / YAML payloads can be strictly validated with Pydantic.
 Front-end and simulation engine share a single source of truth.
 Ruff, mypy and IDEs can leverage the strong typing provided by Enum classes.

IMPORTANT: Changing any enum value is a breaking-change for every
stored configuration file. Add new members whenever possible instead of
renaming existing ones.
