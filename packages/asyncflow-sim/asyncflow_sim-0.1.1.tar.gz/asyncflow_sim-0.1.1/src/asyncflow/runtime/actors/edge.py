"""
Unidirectional link that simulates message transmission between nodes.
Encapsulates network behavior—latency sampling (LogNormal, Exponential, etc.),
drop probability, and optional connection-pool contention—by exposing a
`send(msg)` method. Each `send` call schedules a SimPy subprocess that
waits the sampled delay (and any resource wait) before delivering the
message to the target node's inbox.
