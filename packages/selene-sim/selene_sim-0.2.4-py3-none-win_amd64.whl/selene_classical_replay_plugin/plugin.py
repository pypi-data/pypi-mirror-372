class ClassicalReplayPlugin(Simulator):
    """
    A plugin for running a classical replay simulator in selene. This simulator
    allows a user to predefine the results of measurements for each shot. No
    quantum operations are performed.

    There are three main usecases of the ClassicalReplayPlugin:
    1. To debug the classical user program without running the quantum simulator.
    2. To perform tests of user code with predetermined results
    3. To validate control flow by ensuring that a set of measurements can, or can
       not, have been made within a complete shot. E.g. consider a user program that
       halts on the first measurement result of |1>. This simulator will raise an error
       if the supplied measurements do not contain a |1> result, or contain results following
       a |1> result.

    Attributes:
        measurements (list[list[bool]): A list of lists of booleans, where each inner
            list represents the boolean measurement results for a single shot.
