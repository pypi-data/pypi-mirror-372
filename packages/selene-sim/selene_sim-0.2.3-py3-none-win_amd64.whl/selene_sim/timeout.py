    A configuration struct for describing timeouts for various aspects
    of a simulation run.

    can take precedence. For instance, if `overall` is set and `per_shot`
    is not, then a shot will still be limited by the overall timeout.

    Attributes:
        backend_startup: The maximum amount of time to wait for a Selene
                         backend process to successfully connect to the
                         frontend TCP server after being started.
        per_result: The maximum amount of time to wait on a results stream
                    read within a shot. This is to be used where results are
                    expected at relatively regular intervals, such as a loop
                    within the user program, where a long pause between results
                    may indicate a problem.
        per_shot: The maximum amount of time to allow a single shot to run.
        overall: The maximum amount of time to allow run_shots to complete.
