class DepolarizingPlugin(ErrorModel):
    """
    A plugin for simulating depolarizing error models in quantum systems.
    This class represents a depolarizing error model with configurable error
    probabilities for single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, measurement errors,
    and initialization errors. It ensures that all error probabilities are
    within the valid range of [0, 1].
    Attributes:
        p_1q (float): The error probability for single-qubit gates. Must be
            between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
        p_2q (float): The error probability for two-qubit gates. Must be
            between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
        p_meas (float): The error probability for measurement operations. Must
            be between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
        p_init (float): The error probability for initialization operations.
            Must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
