class Engine(charz_core.Engine):

    It extends the core `Engine` and adds frame tasks
    for managing the clock and screen refresh.

    The run method is wrapped; to set up the screen,
    along side assigning the initial delta time to `Time.delta`.

    Attributes:
        clock (Clock): The clock instance for managing frame timing.
        screen (Screen): The screen instance for rendering output.

    Example:

    ```python
    from charz import Engine, Screen, Clock

    class MyGame(Engine):
        clock = Clock(fps=8)  # Set frames per second
        screen = Screen(
            width=80,
            height=24,
            initial_clear=True,
        )
    ```

    Could also use a custom `Screen` subclass (`charz_rust.RustScreen`),
    that was implemented in `Rust` for better performance
