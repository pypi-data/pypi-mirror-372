# Data from Fowler et al., 2022 Supplementary Information and Tables
# Relations and 1st-degree constraints are primarily inferred from relatedness coefficients and IBD information in Supplementary Table 5
# Additional constraints based on haplogroup rarity and recombination breakpoints are taken from Supplementary Information Section 2.3 and 2.4
