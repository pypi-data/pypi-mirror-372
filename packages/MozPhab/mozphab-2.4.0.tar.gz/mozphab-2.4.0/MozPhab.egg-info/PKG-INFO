        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
        *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
        *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
        *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
        *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *

        *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
        *                                                                      *

        *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
        *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
        *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------
        
        10.1. New Versions
        
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
        
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
        file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
        file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
        for such a notice.
        
        You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

- `ui.no_ansi` : Never use ANSI colours (default: auto-detected).
- `ui.hyperlinks` : Enable terminal hyperlinks for revision IDs and bug numbers (default: `True`).
- `vcs.safe_mode` : Use only safe VCS settings (default: `False`). Use `--safe-mode`
    option to switch it on for a one-time usage.
- `git.remote`: Comma separated string. Default remotes used to find the first
    unpublished commit. Default, empty string, means that a list of remotes will
    be read from `git remote` command.
- `git.command_path`: Command path to Git binary.
- `hg.command_path`: Command path to Mercurial binary.
- `submit.auto_submit` : When `True` the confirmation prompt will be skipped (default:
    `False`).
- `submit.always_blocking` : When `True` reviewers in commit descriptions will be
    marked as blocking. reviewers specified on the command line override this setting
    (default: `False`).
- `submit.warn_untracked` : When `True` show a warning if there are uncommitted or
    untracked changes in the working directory (default: `True`).
- `patch.apply_to` : [base/here] Where to apply the patches by default. If `"base"`
    `moz-phab` will look for the SHA1 in the first commit. If `"here"` - current
    commit/checkout will be used (default: base).
- `patch.create_bookmark` : Affects only when patching a Mercurial repository. If
    `True` moz-phab will create a bookmark (based on the last revision number)
    for the new DAG branch point.
- `patch.create_topic` : Affects only when patching a Mercurial repository.
    Requires the `topic` extension to be enabled. If `True` moz-phab will
    create a topic (based on the last revision number) for the new DAG branch
    point.
- `patch.create_branch` : Affects only when patching a Git repository. If
    `True` moz-phab will create a branch (based on the last revision number)
    for the new DAG branch point.
- `patch.always_full_stack` : When `False` and the patched revision has successors,
    moz-phab will ask if the whole stack should be patched instead. If `True`
    moz-phab will do it without without asking.
- `patch.branch_name_template` : The template string to use for naming the new branch,
    topic or bookmark. The string takes a single format string input, `rev_id`, which
    is the ID of the revision being patched.
- `patch.create_commit` : If `True` (the default) a commit will be generated for
    the patch. Applies the changes with the `patch` command.
- `updater.self_last_check` : Epoch timestamp (local timezone) indicating the last
   time an update check was performed for this script.  set to `-1` to disable
   this check.
- `self_auto_update` : When `True` moz-phab will auto-update if a new version is
    available. If `False` moz-phab will only warn about the new version.
- `get_pre_releases` : When `True` moz-phab auto-update will fetch pre-releases
   if they are available, otherwise pre-releases will be ignored (default: `False`).
- `error_reporting.report_to_sentry` : When `True` moz-phab will submit exceptions
   to Sentry so moz-phab devs can see unreported errors.

### Environment Variables

`moz-phab` can also be configured via the following environment variables:

- `DEBUG` : Enabled debugging output (default: disabled).
- `MOZPHAB_NO_USER_CONFIG` : Do not read from or write to `~/.moz-phab-config`
  (default: disabled).
- `DISABLE_SPINNER` : Set to any value in the environment to disable the spinner
  (default: the spinner is enabled).

## Execution

To get information about all available commands run

```shell
moz-phab -h
```

All commands involving VCS (like `submit` and `patch`) might be used with a
`--safe-mode` switch. It will run the VCS command with only chosen set of extensions.

### Submitting commits to Phabricator

The simplest invocation is

```shell
moz-phab [start_rev] [end_rev]
```

If no positional arguments (`start_rev`/`end_rev`) are given, the
range of commits is automatically determined, starting with the first
non-public, non-obsolete changeset (for Mercurial) or first unpublished commit
(for Git) and ending with the currently checked-out changeset. If at least one
argument is given `moz-phab` is following the underlying VCS's `log` behavior.
The first argument is interpreted differently in Mercurial (as inclusive) and
Git (exclusive). If only one argument is given the end of range is again
interpreted as the currently checked-out changeset.  If both arguments are
given - the second one is interpreted as inclusive.

Bug IDs and reviewers are parsed out of commit messages by default.
You can set a reviewer as blocking by appending an exclamation mark to
the reviewer's nick, e.g.  `r=foo!`.  If `submit.always_blocking` is
set to `true` (see above), reviewers will always be set to blocking
regardless.

A bug ID can also be set *for every revision in the series* with the
`--bug` option, which overrides any bug IDs in commit messages.
Similarly, reviewers can be set *for every revision in the series*
with `--reviewer` (regular reviewers) and/or `--blocker` (blocking
reviewers), which again overrides any reviewers in commit messages.

Run `moz-phab submit -h` for more options for submitting revisions.

To submit updates to a commit series, run `moz-phab` in the same way
with the same arguments, that is, specifying the full original range
of commits.  Note that, while inserting and amending commits should
work fine, reordering commits is not yet supported, and deleting
commits will leave the associated revisions open, which should be
abandoned manually.  See
[bug 1481539](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1481539) for
planned fixes.  Also note that "fix-up" commits are not yet supported;
see [bug 1481542](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1481542).

### Downloading a patch from Phabricator

`moz-phab patch` allows patching an entire stack of revisions. The simplest
invocation is

```shell
moz-phab patch revision_id
```

To patch a stack ending with the revision `D123` run `moz-phab patch D123`.
Diffs will be downloaded from Phabricator and applied using the underlying
VCS (`import` for Mercurial or `apply` for Git). A commit for each revision will
be created in a new bookmark or topic (Mercurial) or branch (Git).

This behavior can be modified with the following options:

- `--apply-to TARGET` Define the commit to which apply the patch:
  - `base` (default) find the base commit in the first ancestor of the revision,
  - `here` use the current commit,
  - `{NODE}` use a commit identified by SHA1 or (in Mercurial) revision number

- `--raw` Print out the diffs of each revision starting from the oldest
   ancestor instead of applying to the repository. It can be used to patch the
   working directory with an external tool:
   `$ moz-phab patch D123 --raw | patch -p1`.
   `$ moz-phab patch D123 --raw | hg import`.
   `$ moz-phab patch D123 --raw | git am`.

- `--no-commit` Use the `git apply` command (also for Mercurial repos) to patch
   the diffs. No commit or branch is created.

- `--no-bookmark` : used only when patching a Mercurial repository. If not
    provided - `moz-phab` will create a bookmark (based on the last revision number)
    for the new DAG branch point. The default behavior [is configurable](#configuration).

- `--no-topic` : used only when patching a Mercurial repository. Requires the
    `topic` extension to be enabled. If not provided and enabled in the
    configuration - `moz-phab` will create a topic (based on the last revision
    number) for the new DAG branch point. The default behavior [is
    configurable](#configuration).

- `--no-branch`: used only when patching a Git repository. If not provided -
    `moz-phab` will create a branch (based on the revision number). Otherwise
    commits will be added just on top of the *base commit* which might result
    in switching the repository to the 'detached HEAD' state.

- `--skip-dependencies` : patch only one revision, ignore dependencies.

- `--diff-id DIFF_ID`: used to specify a specific diff within a revision's
   history to pull.

### Reorganizing the stack

`moz-phab reorg [start_rev] [end_rev]` allows you to reorganize the stack in Phabricator.

If you've changed the local stack by adding, removing or moving the commits around,
you need to change the parent/child relation of the revisions in Phabricator.

`moz-phab reorg` command will compare the stack, display what will be changed
and ask for permission before taking any action.

This behavior can be modified with the following options:

- `--no-abandon` Avoid abandoning revisions on Phabricator when they have been
  removed from the local stack. Only change the dependency relationships between
  revisions.

### Associating a commit to an existing phabricator revision

`moz-phab` tracks which revision is associated with a commit using a line in the
commit message. If you want to work on an existing revision from a different
machine or environment, we recommend you [apply the existing revision from
Phabricator using `moz-phab patch`](#downloading-a-patch-from-phabricator).

If that isn't an option for whatever reason, you can associate a new commit to
the same revision by adding a line similar to the following to the extended
commit message:

```text
Differential Revision: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D[revision]
```

replacing `[revision]` with the identifier of your revision.

### Submitting an uplift request

`moz-phab uplift` can be used to submit a patch for uplift to a release repository,
bypassing the standard release train cycles. See [the Release Management wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Feature_Uplift)
for more details about uplifts.

To see which trains can be submitted for an uplift request:

```shell
moz-phab uplift --list-trains
```

`moz-phab uplift` uses the same syntax as `moz-phab submit`. To submit an uplift
request against mozilla-beta:

```shell
moz-phab uplift start_rev end_rev --train beta
```

When you submit an uplift within a unified repo (i.e., `mozilla-unified` or `gecko-dev`),
`moz-phab uplift` will attempt to rebase the changes onto the head of the target
train, while keeping the existing revisions in your VCS. When submitting an uplift
from a non-unified repo (i.e., `mozilla-central`, `autoland` etc.) no new changesets
will be created. You can disable the rebasing behaviour with `--no-rebase`.

Once your request has been submitted, navigate to the tip commit of your stack
and request an uplift using the action menu, in the same way you accept a revision.

## Reporting Issues

We use [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) to track development.

File bugs in Bugzilla under
[Conduit :: moz-phab](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Conduit&component=moz-phab).

## Development

All python code must be formatted with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)
using the default settings.

### MacOS / Linux

1. Ensure you have Python 3, Git, and Mercurial installed
   - E.g. using `homebrew` on macOS, or your Linux distribution's package manager
   - `python3`, `git`, and `hg` executables must be on the system path
2. In your clone of this repository run the following commands (adjusting to the
   version of Python):

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r dev/requirements/python3.9.txt
   pip3 install -e .
   ```

3. To run moz-phab after making modifications use `moz-phab`
4. To run tests use `pytest -vv`
5. To exit the virtual environment, use `deactivate`

### Windows

1. Install Python 3, Git, and Mercurial:
   - Run `python3` from the command prompt and install from the Windows store.
   - Install Git and Mercurial with their respective installers from the
     official websites.
   - `python3`, `git`, and `hg` executables must be on the system path
2. In your clone of this repository run the following commands:
   - `python3 -m venv venv`
   - `venv\Scripts\pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt`
   - `venv\Scripts\pip3 install -e .`
3. To run moz-phab after making modifications use `venv\Scripts\moz-phab`
4. To run tests use `venv\Scripts\pytest -vv`

### Regenerating requirements files

Requirements files (those found in the `dev/requirements` directory) are automatically
generated using pip-tools. These requirement files are used in the CircleCI
configuration to install requirements that run remotely on CircleCI. You can use
Docker to regenerate these files.

#### On Linux

To generate `dev/requirements/python*.*.txt`, run the following commands while
in the `dev` directory:

- `docker-compose run generate-python3.9-requirements`
- `docker-compose run generate-python3.10-requirements`

#### On Windows

To generate `dev/requirements/windows.txt`, make sure you are not running Docker
in WSL mode then run the following command:

- `docker-compose run generate-windows-requirements`

### Circle CI

`mozphab` uses Circle CI to ensure all tests pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

To ensure that your changes work, run `circleci` locally.

1. Ensure you have the `circleci` client installed, see the [CircleCI CLI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)
2. In your clone of this repository, run:
   `circleci local execute test_3_9`

This will run all the Python 3.9 tests in a dockerized environment.
This step takes a while, so you might want to run `pytest` for working on your changes,
as explained above.

#### Circle CI on Windows

As of the time of writing, `circleci-cli` on Windows does not allow you to execute
Windows tests locally. When CircleCI is running your windows tests remotely, it will
use a Windows Orb that is configured to use a special Windows executor that is preloaded
with various development packages. The Windows virtual machine will use Miniconda
to bootstrap the Python environment, which can cause some problems when installing
additional requirements. The `generate-windows` container that is used to generate
requirements files for Windows can be used to run your tests, as well as to test
package installation. To do that, run the following commands:

- `docker-compose run generate-windows powershell.exe`
- `cd C:\review`
- `pip install dev\requirements\windows.txt`
- `pytest`

### Submitting patches

Pull Requests are not accepted here; please submit changes to Phabricator using `moz-phab`.

1. Follow the [setup](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html#setting-up-mozphab)
2. Once your patch is written and committed locally, run `moz-phab` to send it to
   Phabricator.

### Local environment

By using [suite](https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/suite), you can run a local
environment with its own instances of Phabricator, BMO, Hg, and other services.

This enables more thorough integration testing of `moz-phab` without affecting
production data.

You can order the suite to use your local code by calling:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.review.yml run local-dev
```

### Creating Releases

To cut a new release of `moz-phab`:

1. Create a tag matching the version number. This will kick off CircleCI jobs
   to generate the release and push it to PyPI.

    ```shell
    git tag -a 1.2.0 origin/main
    git push origin 1.2.0
    ```

2. Post about the new release in the following channels. Run the `dev/release_announcement.py`
   script to generate text for the post.
