# MicroRapid Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

MicroRapid is a universal API execution engine that makes existing API specifications directly executable without conversion. Built on the core insight that "APIs should be executable, not just documented," MicroRapid eliminates the need for multiple tools by providing a single CLI that can execute OpenAPI specs, GraphQL schemas, and cURL commands directly.

**Tagline:** "Your OpenAPI, but executable"

## Product Vision & Positioning

### Core Vision Statement
Transform API specifications from static documentation into executable runtime environments, enabling developers to test, validate, and interact with APIs using their existing specification files.

### Market Position
- **Not:** Another API testing tool or format converter
- **But:** The missing execution layer for existing API specifications
- **Differentiator:** Direct execution without intermediate file generation

### Target Problem
Developers have API specifications (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) but need separate tools to actually test and interact with these APIs, leading to maintenance of multiple formats and sync drift.

## Core Value Propositions

### Primary Value
- **Zero Learning Curve** - Uses existing OpenAPI/GraphQL knowledge
- **No Format Conversion** - Execute specs directly, no intermediate files
- **Always In Sync** - No drift between specs and tests
- **Universal Support** - One tool for multiple API formats

### Developer Benefits
- **Faster Development** - Instant API testing from specs
- **Reduced Maintenance** - Single source of truth
- **CI/CD Ready** - Built-in automation support
- **Cross-Platform** - Works everywhere Rust runs

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **API Developers** - Building and maintaining REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Frontend Developers** - Consuming APIs, need quick testing
- **DevOps Engineers** - Automating API testing in CI/CD pipelines
- **QA Engineers** - API testing and validation

### User Personas

#### Backend Developer (Primary)
- Has OpenAPI specs for their APIs
- Needs quick way to test endpoints during development
- Wants CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Values speed and simplicity

#### Frontend Developer (Secondary)
- Consumes APIs documented with OpenAPI
- Needs to quickly test API endpoints
- Wants to verify API behavior matches specification
- Often works with GraphQL APIs

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features (MVP)

#### 1. OpenAPI Direct Execution
```bash
# Execute OpenAPI operations directly
mrapids run openapi.yaml --operation getUserById --data user.json
mrapids run openapi.yaml --operation createUser --data '{"name":"John"}'
mrapids test openapi.yaml --all-operations
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parse OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 specifications
- Execute GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- Support path parameters, query parameters, request bodies
- Handle authentication (Bearer, API Key, Basic Auth)
- Validate responses against OpenAPI schemas
- Support environment variables and data injection

#### 2. GraphQL Schema Execution
```bash
# Execute GraphQL queries from schema
mrapids run schema.graphql --query getUserById --variables user.json
mrapids run schema.graphql --mutation createUser --variables '{"name":"John"}'
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parse GraphQL schema definition files (.graphql, .gql)
- Execute queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Support variable injection
- Validate queries against schema
- Handle GraphQL-specific authentication

#### 3. cURL Command Execution
```bash
# Execute cURL commands with organization
mrapids run commands.curl --batch
mrapids run commands.curl --filter auth-endpoints
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parse cURL command syntax
- Support major cURL flags and options
- Handle environment variable substitution
- Batch execution capabilities

### Enhanced Features (Post-MVP)

#### 4. Watch Mode & Live Reload
```bash
# Watch for spec changes and re-run tests
mrapids watch openapi.yaml --operation getUserById
mrapids watch schema.graphql --auto-test
```

#### 5. Data Generation & Testing
```bash
# Generate test data from schemas
mrapids generate data --from openapi.yaml --output test-data.json
mrapids test openapi.yaml --with-generated-data
```

#### 6. Performance Testing
```bash
# Load testing from specifications
mrapids perf openapi.yaml --operation getUserById --concurrent 100
mrapids perf schema.graphql --query allUsers --duration 60s
```

#### 7. Contract Validation
```bash
# Verify API implementation matches specification
mrapids verify openapi.yaml --against https://api.example.com
mrapids diff openapi-v1.yaml openapi-v2.yaml
```
