- **Why Matters**: Enables dynamic security policies based on operation sensitivity
- **Competitive Edge**: More sophisticated than simple allow/deny lists

#### Automatic Response Redaction
- **What**: Removes sensitive data before returning to AI agents
- **Patterns**: Passwords, tokens, credit cards, SSNs, custom regex
- **Competitive Edge**: Prevents data leakage through AI systems

### 2. Enterprise Control Features

#### Multi-Tier Rate Limiting
```yaml
rate_limits:
  per_minute: 60
  per_hour: 1000
  per_day: 10000
  burst_capacity: 100
  
operation_limits:
  - pattern: "delete*"
    per_minute: 5
  - pattern: "list*"
    per_minute: 200
```

#### Cost Control
- Daily budget limits ($X per day)
- Per-operation cost tracking

### 3. AI-Specific Features

#### Structured Error Responses
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 1002,
    "message": "Policy violation: Operation blocked",
    "data": {
      "operation": "deleteUser",
      "reason": "DELETE operations not allowed",
      "policy": "readonly-policy"
    }
  }
}
```
