This package can also be used as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

To add this server to and MCP client like Claude Code, use:

```bash
# install the package
uv pip install stackone-ai

# add the server to Claude Code
claude mcp add stackone uv stackmcp ["--api-key", "<your-api-key>"]
```

This implementation is a work in progress and will likely change dramatically in the near future.
