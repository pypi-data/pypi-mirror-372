    Artificial Intelligence Overview
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
    intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
    
    Key areas of AI include:
    - Machine Learning: Algorithms that improve through experience
    - Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language
    - Computer Vision: Interpreting and understanding visual information
    - Robotics: Creating intelligent physical agents
    
    AI has applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and many other fields.

    Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the 
    development of algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data without being 
    explicitly programmed for every scenario.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
    
    Common algorithms include:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Neural Networks
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Random Forest
    
    ML is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, fraud detection, and more.
