## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install ragpackai:**
   ```bash
   pip install ragpackai
   ```

2. **Set up API keys:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   # Optional: Add other provider keys
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 01_getting_started.ipynb
   ```

4. **Or try the Python scripts:**
   ```bash
   python basic_usage.py
   ```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- At least one AI provider API key (OpenAI recommended for beginners)
- Jupyter Notebook (for .ipynb files)

## üéØ Learning Path

1. **Start here:** `01_getting_started.ipynb` - Learn the basics
2. **Go deeper:** `02_advanced_features.ipynb` - Master advanced features  
3. **Build real apps:** `03_real_world_examples.ipynb` - See production examples
4. **Automate:** `cli_examples.sh` - Use the command line interface

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Start small:** Begin with a few documents to understand the workflow
- **Experiment:** Try different chunk sizes and providers to see what works best
- **Use encryption:** Always encrypt packs containing sensitive data
- **Monitor performance:** Check pack statistics and query times
- **Read the docs:** Each notebook has detailed explanations and best practices
