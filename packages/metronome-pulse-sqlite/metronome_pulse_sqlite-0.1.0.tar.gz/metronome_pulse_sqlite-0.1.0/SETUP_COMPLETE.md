## 🚀 How to Use

### Installation
```bash
cd datametronome/pulse/sqlite
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific test types
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-slow

# With coverage
make test-cov
```

### Development
```bash

```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The SQLite connector follows the established DataPulse pattern:

- **`SQLitePulse`**: Full-featured connector implementing both read and write operations
- **`SQLiteReadonlyPulse`**: Optimized for read-only operations and analytics
- **`SQLiteWriteonlyPulse`**: Specialized for high-volume data ingestion

All connectors implement the core DataPulse interfaces:
- `Pulse`: Base connection management
- `Readable`: Query and data retrieval operations
- `Writable`: Data insertion and modification operations

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Async-First**: Built with async/await patterns for modern Python
- **Local Storage**: Optimized for local development and testing
- **High Performance**: Efficient bulk operations and query optimization
- **Type Safe**: Full type hints and runtime validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Professional Structure**: PyPI-ready with proper documentation

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test the Setup**: Run `python verify_setup.py` to verify everything works
2. **Run Examples**: Try the basic usage and performance benchmark examples
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `make test` to ensure all tests pass
4. **Development**: Use the provided tools for ongoing development
5. **PyPI Release**: When ready, use `make build` and `make check` for release

## 🎯 CODE RULE CLUB Compliance

This setup follows all the established standards:
- ✅ Professional PyPI package structure
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with unit/integration separation
- ✅ Modern Python practices (type hints, async/await)
- ✅ Proper dependency management
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples
- ✅ Development tooling and automation

The SQLite connector is now ready for development, testing, and eventual PyPI release! 🚀
