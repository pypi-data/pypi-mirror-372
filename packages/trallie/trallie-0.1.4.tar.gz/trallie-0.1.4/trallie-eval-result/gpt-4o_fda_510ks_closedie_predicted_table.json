This assay is calibrated against Secobarbital. This in vitro diagnostic device is for prescription use only. The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/ Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures. The Immunalysis Barbiturates Urine Enzyme Immunoassay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC-MS or LC-MS/MS is the preferred confirmatory method.

The Applied Biosystems Bacillus anthracis Detection Kit is intended to test human whole blood (EDTA) specimens and blood culture specimens with growth detected by a continuous monitoring blood culture system. Blood culture specimens must be determined to contain gram-positive bacilli by Gram stain prior to testing. Testing of whole blood specimens must be performed concomitantly with standard of care blood culture. The Applied Biosystems Bacillus anthracis Detection Kit is indicated for use in CLIA-certified high-complexity laboratories in response to a confirmed Bacillus anthracis event only in accordance with the guidelines provided by public health authorities prior to or during a public health emergency. Testing with the Applied Biosystems Bacillus anthracis Detection Kit must only be performed when public health authorities have determined the need for this test. The test must only be used with specimens from individuals with clinical signs and symptoms of B. anthracis infection and who have either been exposed to B. anthracis or may have been exposed to B anthracis. The Applied Biosystems Bacillus anthracis Detection Kit is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of anthrax infection and results are for the presumptive identification of Bacillus anthracis. The diagnosis of B. anthracis infection must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure likelihood, and other laboratory evidence, in addition to the identification of B. anthracis from cultures or directly from clinical specimens. The definitive identification of B. anthracis requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with the appropriate public health authorities for whom reports may be required. The Applied Biosystems Bacillus anthracis Detection Kit has not been clinically evaluated with specimens collected from individuals with B. anthracis infection or those presumed to be exposed to B. anthracis. \u2018B. anthracis Not detected\u2019 results do not preclude infection with Bacillus anthracis and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Laboratories implementing this test must have the appropriate biosafety equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), containment facilities and personnel trained in the safe handling of diagnostic clinical specimens potentially containing B. anthracis. Anthrax is a nationally notifiable disease caused by a biothreat microbial agent and must be reported to public health authorities. The distribution of in vitro diagnostic devices for Bacillus spp. detection is limited to laboratories that follow public health guidelines that address appropriate biosafety conditions, interpretation of test results, and coordination of findings with public health authorities.

The organism types and subtypes detected by the test are Influenza A, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus B, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza virus 1, Parainfluenza virus 2, Parainfluenza virus 3, Parainfluenza virus 4, Human Bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The test is indicated as an aid in the detection and identification of viral and bacterial agents causing respiratory tract infections in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients, who are either hospitalized, admitted to emergency departments or who are outpatients with suspected respiratory tract infection. The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions. Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens not detected by this test or lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other pathogens. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory tract infection.",
