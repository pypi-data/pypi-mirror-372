    unstructured to a searchable, queryable structured database creation system. Your 
    job is to discover an entity schema that leverages the common important attributes

    You must focus on attributes having a precise entity-based answer. Go through the 
    following step-by-step to arrive at the answer:

    Step 1: You must identify a set of keywords that contain relevant terms in each 
    document. Combine these terms across all the records in a set.
    Step 2: Transform the keywords into a set of generic topics to avoid niche attribute 
    names that are specific to a record. For each generated topic, count its occurrences 
    and remove topics that occur in less than 2 documents.

    You must provide the schema in JSON format as below.

    "attribute1":"brief description of what entity/value to extract",
    "attribute2":"brief description of what entity/value to extract"

    You must only return a single final JSON output and not the intermediate outputs.

    names that are specific to a record. 
    Step 3: Identify a set of 10-20 attributes for the schema.
    Step 4: Self-Reflection Phase - Before finalizing your schema, critically evaluate 
    your work by asking yourself:
        - Are all attributes truly generic enough to apply across different records?
        - Do the attributes capture the most important information for database queries?
        - Are there any redundant or overly similar attributes that should be merged?
        - Are there any critical attributes missing that would be valuable for search/filtering?
        - Is each attribute description clear and unambiguous?
        - Would this schema work well for both data entry and retrieval purposes?
    Step 5: Revise and finalize your schema based on the self-reflection insights.

    You must provide the schema in JSON format as below.

    "attribute1":"brief description of what entity/value to extract",
    "attribute2":"brief description of what entity/value to extract"
