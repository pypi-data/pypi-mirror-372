        A route is a navigable path between a start location, or origin, and
        an end location, or destination. You can choose to get a route for
        different modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or
        different types of vehicles. You can also request route details such
        as distance, estimated time to navigate the route, expected tolls, and
        step-by-step instructions to navigate the route.
        You can use a route to help you determine the most efficient routes
        for dispatch scheduling, such as:
        - How best to assign a set of workers to pick up a series of packages

        - The best warehouse from which to ship packages to their final
        destination

        The Routes API provides several options to customize the types of
        routes and information provided in a route response. These guide
        topics can help you get started:

        A route matrix contains a matrix of information for recommended routes
        between multiple start and end points, including distance and

        You can use a route matrix to help you choose the best combinations of
        origins and destinations based on your business needs, such as the
        following use cases:
        - Find the best warehouses from which to send out deliveries.

        - Match the closest suitable vehicle to make a pick-up or drop-off
        request.
