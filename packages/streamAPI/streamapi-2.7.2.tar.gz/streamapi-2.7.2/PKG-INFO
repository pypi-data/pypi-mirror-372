## Philosophy

We, in day to day data handling, have to usually setup pipeline to process
data, that can be transforming data, filtering it, processing it sequentially
or concurrently, reducing it and so on. StreamAPI attempts to provide solution to such problem in
clean and easy way and enforces readability.

## Installing

Make sure that you use `python3.8` or above,

```bash
pip install streamAPI -U
```
