This module provides an easy way to review the quantities scheduled for delivery on a given day. By default, it groups stock moves by `Product` and displays today's stock moves. Additional filters are available, including `Tomorrow's Deliveries`, `Next 7 Days' Deliveries`, and `Next 14 Days' Deliveries`.

Usage
=====

1. Create a sales order with a field service product and confirm it.
- Create a sales order.
- Choose a customer with an FSM location, for example, `Test Location`.
- Add a product with the `Field Service Tracking` option set to `Create one FSM order per sale order`.
- Confirm the sales order to generate the corresponding stock picking and FSM order.

2. Check quantities to be delivered.
- Navigate to `Field Service` > `Operations` > `Delivery Quantities`.
- Stock moves are grouped, by default, by `Product` and filtered to show today's stock moves. This allows the user to see, at a quick glance, the quantities to be delivered on a given day. Further filters are available, such as `Tomorrow's Deliveries`, `Next 7 Days' Deliveries`, and `Next 14 Days' Deliveries`.
