## ✨ Update: `get()` Rebranded as `info()`

The `get()` function is being rebranded to `info()` in upcoming versions.

> 💡 The **new** `info()` **function** will offer:
>
> * Cleaner and more relevant results
> * Enhanced precision
> * Better support for scientific and factual queries

## 🌟 Introducing the Brand New `get()` Function!

🚀 CosmoTalker v2 now features the **revamped `get()` function**, designed to deliver **accurate answers** for your keyword queries in **milliseconds**! Whether you're exploring planets, scientific concepts, or cosmic phenomena, `get()` provides **precise, reliable results** with lightning-fast performance.

### ✨ Why `get()` Stands Out
- **Pinpoint Accuracy**: Returns the most relevant information for your keyword.
- **Blazing Speed**: Responses in ~0.0007 seconds, thanks to optimized offline data processing.
- **Versatile Queries**: Supports queries like planets (`get("mars")`), science facts (`get("gravity")`), and more.
- **Offline Ready**: Core data is bundled, so no internet is needed for most queries.

### 🧪 Example Usage
```python
import cosmotalker

print(cosmotalker.get("earth"))    # Instant data about Earth

#Stay tuned for future enhancements!
```

## 🐧 Install CosmoTalker on Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && pip3 install cosmotalker
```
