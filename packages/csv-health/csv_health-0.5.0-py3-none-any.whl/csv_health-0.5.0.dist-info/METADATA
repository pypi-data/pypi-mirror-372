# csv-health

**csv-health** is a lightweight Python library for quick auditing and health checks of CSV datasets.  
It is designed for analysts, data engineers, and ML practitioners who need an easy way to validate and inspect CSV files before further processing.

## Why use csv-health?

Working with CSV files can be tricky:
- missing values scattered across columns,
- inconsistent datatypes,
- duplicate rows,
- unexpected encodings.

`csv-health` helps you answer the question: **"Is my CSV clean and ready to use?"**

The library provides:
- 📊 **Comprehensive audit reports** (row/column counts, missing data, datatypes, duplicates).  
- 🗂 **Auto-generated logs**: audit results are saved in both **JSON** and **TXT** formats.  
- 🏠 **Isolated storage** inside your virtual environment (`<venv>/var/csv_health`).  
- 🔄 **State management**: the library remembers the last analyzed file, so you can re-use it without re-specifying paths.  
- ✨ **Simple API**: one function call gives you all essential stats.
