# FlexBench Module

This is the main module for FlexBench, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models and frameworks.
We recommend users to run the CLI commands directly from the command line for the best experience (see [`README.md`](../../README.md) for details).

While the flexbench module is not intended to be used directly in Python scripts, you can still test it by running the following command:

```bash
python -m flexbench --help
```

Running the python module requires an already running vLLM server to connect to.
