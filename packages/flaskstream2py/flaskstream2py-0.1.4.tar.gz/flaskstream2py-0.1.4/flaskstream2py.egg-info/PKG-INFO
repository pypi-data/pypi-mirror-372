# flaskstream2py
stream2py interface for incoming HTTP requests with Flask.

To install:	```pip install flaskstream2py```

## Purpose

This WIP library is intended to provide tools for a server or controller receiving data streams from an edge device over HTTP. This will enable consumers written for a stream2py interface to read streaming data from networked devices.
