# PyXMake
PyXMake is a python-based, cross-platform build tool for compiling and distributing software projects and their documentation. The package provides harmonized software interfaces and predefined workflows to selected third-party developer tools with stricter default settings to simplify their handling. Experienced users can use a collection of distinct build classes to set up more elaborate builds jobs.
## Usage
The package is structured into different build classes, whereby each class represents one distinct build event with some presets. These classes can be accessed directly to create a custom python-based build script.
## Reference
Currently, the following SY-STM software projects are built and maintained by using PyXMake:
* [PyXMake](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/pyxmake) (User Guide & Reference Guide)
* [MCODAC](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/mcodac) (Reference Guide, Libraries)
* [BEOS](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/beos) (Reference Guide, Libraries)
* [Boxbeam](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/boxbeam) (Reference Guide, Libraries)
* [Displam](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/displam) (Executable)
