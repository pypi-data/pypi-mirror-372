# graphql-mcp

A library for automatically generating [FastMCP](https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/) tools from a GraphQL schema.

This allows you to expose your GraphQL API as a set of tools that can be used by other systems, such as AI agents or other services that understand the MCP (Multi-Model-Protocol).

## Features

- **Automatic Tool Generation**: Converts GraphQL queries and mutations into callable Python functions.
- **Type-Safe**: Maps GraphQL scalar types, enums, and input objects to corresponding Python types.
- **`FastMCP` Integration**: Seamlessly adds the generated functions as tools to a `FastMCP` server instance.
- **Modern GraphQL Libraries**: Works with modern, code-first GraphQL libraries like `strawberry-graphql`.
- **Asynchronous Support**: While the tool generation is synchronous, the created tools execute GraphQL queries in a way that can be integrated into asynchronous applications.
- **Remote GraphQL Server Support**: Connect to any remote GraphQL endpoint and automatically generate MCP tools from its schema.
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Built-in support for bearer token authentication with automatic token refresh capability.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Combine bearer tokens with additional headers for complex authentication scenarios.
- **Mutation Control**: Optionally disable mutations to create read-only tool interfaces for enhanced security.

## Installation

You can install `graphql-mcp` using pip. To follow the usage example, you'll also need `strawberry-graphql`:

```bash
pip install graphql-mcp "strawberry-graphql[cli]"
```

## Usage with Strawberry

Here's a simple example of how to use `graphql-mcp` to create tools from a `strawberry-graphql` schema.

```python
# example.py
import asyncio
import strawberry
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from graphql_mcp.server import add_tools_from_schema

# 1. Define your GraphQL schema using Strawberry
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, name: str = "World") -> str:
        """Returns a greeting."""
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def send_message(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Prints a message and returns a confirmation."""
        print(f"Received message: {message}")
        return f"Message '{message}' sent successfully."

# The strawberry.Schema object is compatible with graphql-core's GraphQLSchema
schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)

# 2. Create a FastMCP server instance
server = FastMCP(name="MyGraphQLServer")

# 3. Add tools from the schema
# The `strawberry.Schema` object can be passed directly.
add_tools_from_schema(schema, server)

# 4. Use the generated tools
async def main():
    # You can inspect the tools
    print("Available tools:", server.get_tool_names())
    
    # You can also inspect a specific tool's signature
    print("Tool 'hello' signature:", server.get_tool_signature("hello"))

    # Call a query tool
    result = await server.acall_tool("hello", name="Bob")
    print("Query result:", result)

    # Call a mutation tool
    result = await server.acall_tool("send_message", message="This is a test")
    print("Mutation result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run this script, you will see the following output:

```
Available tools: ['send_message', 'hello']
Tool 'hello' signature: (name: str = 'World') -> str
Query result: Hello, Bob!
Received message: This is a test
Mutation result: Message 'This is a test' sent successfully.
```

## Alternative Usage: `GraphQLMCPServer`

For convenience, you can also use the `GraphQLMCPServer` class, which inherits from `FastMCP` and provides class methods to create a server directly from a schema.

### From a `GraphQLSchema` object

You can use `GraphQLMCPServer.from_schema()` and pass any `graphql-core`-compatible `GraphQLSchema` object. This includes schemas created with `strawberry-graphql`.

### From a Remote GraphQL Server

You can connect to a remote GraphQL endpoint and automatically generate MCP tools from its schema:

```python
# example_remote_server.py
import asyncio
from graphql_mcp.server import GraphQLMCPServer
from fastmcp.client import Client

# Connect to a remote GraphQL server
server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_remote_url(
    url="https://countries.trevorblades.com/",  # Public GraphQL API
    name="Countries API"
)

# With bearer token authentication
authenticated_server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_remote_url(
    url="https://api.example.com/graphql",
    bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",  # Bearer token authentication
    timeout=60,  # Custom timeout in seconds
    name="Private API"
)

# With bearer token and additional headers
multi_auth_server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_remote_url(
    url="https://api.example.com/graphql",
    bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
    headers={
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "X-Request-ID": "request-123"
    },
    timeout=60,
    name="Multi-Auth API"
)

# Read-only server (queries only, no mutations)
readonly_server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_remote_url(
    url="https://api.example.com/graphql",
    bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
    allow_mutations=False,  # Disable mutations for security
    name="Read-Only API"
)

# Use the server - all queries/mutations from the remote schema are now MCP tools
async def main():
    async with Client(server) as client:
        # List available tools
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(f"Available tools: {[tool.name for tool in tools]}")
        
        # Call a tool (executes against the remote server)
        # The actual tool names depend on the remote schema
        # result = await client.call_tool("countries", {"filter": {"currency": {"eq": "USD"}}})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### From a `GraphQLSchema` object

You can use `GraphQLMCPServer.from_schema()` and pass any `graphql-core`-compatible `GraphQLSchema` object. This includes schemas created with `strawberry-graphql`.

```python
# example_from_schema.py
import asyncio
import strawberry
from graphql_mcp.server import GraphQLMCPServer

# 1. Define your schema (e.g., with Strawberry)
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, name: str = "World") -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

# 2. Create the server from the schema
server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_schema(schema, name="MyGraphQLServer")

# 3. Create a read-only server (queries only)
readonly_server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_schema(
    schema, 
    allow_mutations=False,  # Disable mutations
    name="ReadOnlyGraphQLServer"
)

# 4. Use the server
async def main():
    print("Available tools:", server.get_tool_names())
    result = await server.acall_tool("hello", name="From Schema")
    print("Query result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### From a `graphql-api` object

If you are using the `graphql-api` library, you can use the `GraphQLMCPServer.from_api()` method.

```python
# example_from_api.py
import asyncio
from graphql_api import GraphQLAPI, field
from graphql_mcp.server import GraphQLMCPServer, HAS_GRAPHQL_API

# The .from_graphql_api() method is only available if `graphql-api` is installed.
if HAS_GRAPHQL_API:
    # 1. Define your API using `graphql-api`
    class MyAPI:
        @field
        def hello(self, name: str = "World") -> str:
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

    api = GraphQLAPI(roottype=MyAPI)

    # 2. Create the server from the API object
    server = GraphQLMCPServer.from_graphql_api(api)

    # 3. Use the server
    async def main():
        print("Available tools:", server.get_tool_names())
        result = await server.acall_tool("hello", name="From API")
        print("Query result:", result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
```

## How It Works

`graphql-mcp` introspects your GraphQL schema's queries and mutations. For each field, it does the following:

1.  **Creates a Python Function**: A wrapper function is generated that has a signature matching the GraphQL field's arguments.
2.  **Handles Type Conversion**: It maps GraphQL types like `String`, `Int`, `ID`, and custom `Enum` types to their Python equivalents. Input objects are treated as dictionaries.
3.  **Constructs a GraphQL Query**: When the generated function is called, it dynamically constructs the appropriate GraphQL query or mutation string.
4.  **Executes the Query**: It uses `graphql-sync` to execute the query against the schema, passing in the provided arguments as variables.
5.  **Returns the Result**: The data from the GraphQL response is returned.

The tool names are converted from `camelCase` (GraphQL convention) to `snake_case` (Python convention). For example, a mutation `sendMessage` becomes a tool named `send_message`.
