# The Corrected Dockerfile for CLAP Framework

# Use Python 3.11 as the official, stable, and performant base image.
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set a consistent working directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# --- THE FIX IS HERE ---
# Copy ALL project files into the container FIRST.
# This ensures that when pip runs, it has access to your `src` directory.
COPY . .

# Now, with all the files present, run the pip install command.
# This will install the core dependencies AND your local `clap-agents` package correctly.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir .

# The default command to run when the container starts.
CMD ["bash"]
