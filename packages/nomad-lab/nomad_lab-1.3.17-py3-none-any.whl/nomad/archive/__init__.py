The archive storage is made from two tiers. First the whole archive is stored in
files, secondly parts of the archive are stored in mongodb documents.

The file storage is done in msg-pack files. Each file contains the archive of many
entries (all entries of an upload). These msg-pack files contain the JSON serialized
version of the metainfo archive (see module:`nomad.metainfo`). In addition, msg-pack
contains TOC information for quicker access of individual sections. See :func:`write_archive`
and :func:`read_archive`. In addition, there query functionality to partially read
specified sections from an archive: func:`query_archive`.

The mongo storage uses mongodb's native bson to store JSON serialized metainfo archive
data. Each document in mongodb holds the partial archive of single entry. Which parts
of an archive are stored in mongo is determined by the metainfo and
section annotations/categories.
