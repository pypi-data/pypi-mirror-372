    Instances of this class represent blocks of volumetric image data. These

    field contains a 4D numpy array whose dimensions represent z, y, x, and

    3 whose values represent the offset in voxels between the origin of the
    entire image volume and the origin of the block, where the origin is the
    bottom-left corner in either case.
