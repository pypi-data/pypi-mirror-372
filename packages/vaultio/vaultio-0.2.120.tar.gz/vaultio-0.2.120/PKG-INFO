# Unofficial Python API for Bitwarden Vault Management

## Overview

**`vaultio`** is an **unofficial Python API** for managing Bitwarden vaults via the Bitwarden CLI. Instead of launching a new CLI process for each operation, it runs the CLI once in the background and communicates with it through a **private socket connection**. This improves performance and provides a secure method for using the [serve API](https://bitwarden.com/help/vault-management-api/) to build tools and scripts.

## How It Works

The API is built around the stateful Express web server launched by the [`bw serve`](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#serve) command. This server exposes a local REST API for performing vault actions. `vaultio` wraps this API internally and delegates all actions to the Bitwarden CLI.

> **Note:** `vaultio` does **not cache or store credentials**. All requests are proxied directly to the background process.

## Installation

### 📦 Pip

```sh
pip install vaultio
```

### 🔧 Repo

```sh
cd python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

---

## Installing the Bitwarden CLI

### Option 1: Official CLI

By default, `bw serve` exposes its API via **HTTP over TCP**, which can be less secure since other users or apps might access the unlocked vault without proper firewall rules.

You can either:
- Ensure `bw` is available in your `PATH`, or
- Run:

```sh
vaultio build
```

This installs the CLI from the official NPM package [`@bitwarden/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitwarden/cli).

### Option 2: Unofficial Fork with Socket Support

I made a [pull request](https://github.com/bitwarden/vaults/pull/14262) that introduces support for Unix sockets and other socket types in `bw serve`. This allows communication without traversing the network stack, improving security.

To enable this:
- **Manually build** from the fork: [Game4Move78/vaults#vaultio](https://github.com/Game4Move78/vaults/tree/feat/vaultio) and copy the binary to:

```sh
$HOME/.cache/vaultio/bin/bw
```

- **Or**, let `vaultio` handle it for you:

```sh
vaultio --unofficial
```

This will clone the repo and build it locally. Then it will show you a diff against the [official repo](https://github.com/bitwarden/vaults) before prompting you to continue.

## Usage

### 📘 API Documentation

See the full [API reference](https://github.com/Game4Move78/vaultio/blob/master/API.md).

### 📟 CLI Wrapper

```sh
vaultio --help
```

### 🧪 Example: Check Status and List Items

```python
from vaultio.vault import Vault

with Vault() as vault:
    print(vault.status())
    print(vault.unlock())
    print(vault.status())

    for item in vault.list():
        print(item["name"])

    for folder in vault.list(type="folder"):
        print(folder["name"])
```
