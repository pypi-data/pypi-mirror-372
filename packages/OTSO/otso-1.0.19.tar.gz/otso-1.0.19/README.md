# OTSOpy
Python package version of the OTSO tool used for trajectory computations of charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere.

OTSO is designed to be open-source; all suggestions for improvement are welcome, and please report any bugs you find. I welcome any help provided by the community in the development of OTSO.

__Disclaimer!__ OTSOpy is currently only available for Python 3.12. This is due to the compiled Fortran libraries being Python version-specific. It is recommended that you set up a new Python environment using Python 3.12. Users may attempt to clone the repository and compile the Fortran code themselves with f2py, following instructions on the original [OTSO](https://github.com/NLarsen15/OTSO) repository. I will attempt to keep OTSOpy compatible with as many Python versions as possible. However, I hope that the open-source nature of the OTSO tool means that the compiled Fortran libraries users make will be shared and merged with this release, relieving me of some of the pressure.

# Installation

Installation of OTSOpy is designed to be as simple as possible and can be done utilising pip. Users have two options when downloading OTSOpy.

## Option 1: PyPi
Users may install OTSO directly from PyPi using:

`pip install OTSO` 

This will install OTSO into your current Python environment.

## Option 2: Repository
Users may clone the repository and run the setup.py file within the main OTSOpy directory using:

`pip install .`

This will install OTSO into your current Python environment.

# Functions

## Cutoff
Computes the geomagnetic cut-off rigidities for given locations around the Earth under user-inputted geomagnetic conditions.

![Cutoff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLarsen15/OTSOpy/main/src/images/cutoffplot.png)
*Figure 1: Computation of the Oulu neutron monitor effective cut-off rigidity using the IGRF 2000 epoch and TSY89 model with kp index = 0. Penumbra is shown by the forbidden and allowed trajectories being black and white, respectively. The upper and lower cut-off values (Ru and Rl) are denoted in the legend, from which the effective cut-off (Rc) is computed.*

## Cone
Computes the asymptotic viewing directions for given locations around the Earth. Asymptotic latitudes and longitudes over a range of rigidity values are computed.
Asymptotic latitude and longitude can be given in any available coordinate system.

![Cones](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLarsen15/OTSOpy/main/src/images/coneplot.png)

*Figure 2: Asymptotic cones for the Oulu, Nain, South Pole, Thule, and Inuvik neutron monitors for the IGRF 2010 epoch and TSY89 model, with kp = 0. Latitudes and longitudes are in the geocentric coordinate system.*

## Trajectory
Computes and outputs the trajectory of a charged particle with a specified rigidity from a given start location on Earth. Positional information can be in any of the available coordinate systems.

![Trajectory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLarsen15/OTSOpy/main/src/images/Trajectory_Plot.png)

*Figure 3: Computed trajectories of three cosmic rays of various rigidity values being backtraced from the Oulu neutron monitor for the IGRF 2000 and TSY89 model, with kp = 0. The 1GV particle is allowed (able to escape the magnetosphere); the 0.4GV particle is forbidden (it is trapped in the magnetosphere); and the 0.1GV is also forbidden (it returns to Earth).*

## Planet
Performs the cutoff function over a user-defined location grid, allowing for cutoffs for the entire globe to be computed instead of individual locations. There is the option to return the asymptotic viewing directions at each computed location by utilising a user-inputted list of rigidity levels.


![Planet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLarsen15/OTSOpy/main/src/images/planetplot.png)
*Figure 4: Computed vertical effective cut-off rigidities across a 5째x5째 grid of the Earth. These computations were done using the IGRF 2000 epoch and TSY89 model, with kp = 0.*

## Flight
Computes the cut-off rigidities along a user-defined path. The function is named Flight as it is primarily been developed for use in aviation tools, but any path can be entered. For example, the function can be applied to geomagnetic latitude surveys using positional data from a ship voyage, or it can be used to compute anisotropy and cut-off values for low-Earth orbit spacecraft. This function allows for changing altitude, location, and date values. 

## Trace
Traces the magnetic field lines around the globe or for a given location based on the geomagnetic configuration detailed by the user. It is useful for modelling the magnetosphere structure under disturbed conditions and for finding open magnetic field lines.

![Trace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NLarsen15/OTSOpy/main/src/images/traceplot.png)
*Figure 5: Computation of magnetic field line configuration in the X-Z plane on January 1st 2000 12:00:00. IGRF and TSY01 models used, and input variables were obtained using the server data option within OTSO.*

## Coordtrans
Converts input positional information from one coordinate system to another, utilising the [IRBEM](https://github.com/PRBEM/IRBEM) library of coordinate transforms.

## Magfield
Computes the total magnetic field strength at a given location depending on the user's input geomagnetic conditions. Outputs will be in the geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system.

# Examples

## Cutoff

```python
import OTSO

if __name__ == '__main__':
    stations_list = ["OULU", "ROME", "ATHN", "CALG"]  # list of neutron monitor stations (using their abbreviations)

    cutoff = OTSO.cutoff(Stations=stations_list, corenum=1, year=2000, month=1, day=1, hour=0)

    print(cutoff[0])  # dataframe output containing Ru, Rc, Rl for all input locations
    print(cutoff[1])  # text output of input variable information
```

### Output
Ru = upper cut-off rigidity [GV]

Rc = effective cut-off rigidity [GV]

Rl = lower cut-off rigidity [GV]

```
      ATHN  CALG  OULU  ROME
Ru    8.92  1.15  0.72  6.34
Rc    8.68  1.12  0.67  6.17
Rl    8.57  1.02  0.62  5.00
```

## Cone

```python
import OTSO

if __name__ == '__main__':

    stations_list = ["OULU","ROME","ATHN","CALG"] # list of neutron monitor stations (using their abbreviations)

    cone = OTSO.cone(Stations=stations_list,corenum=1,year=2000,month=1,day=1,hour=0)

    print(cone[0]) # dataframe output containing asymptotic cones for all input locations
    print(cone[1]) # dataframe output containing Ru, Rc, Rl for all inputted locations
    print(cone[2]) # text output of input variable information
```

### Output
Showing only the cone[0] output containing the asymptotic viewing directions of the input stations. Result layout is: filter;latitude;longitude.
If the filter value is 1, then the particle of that rigidity has an allowed trajectory. If the filter value is NOT 1, then the particle of that rigidity has a forbidden trajectory.

# Acknowledgements
The fantastic IRBEM library has been used in the development of OTSO, which proved an invaluable asset and greatly sped up development. The latest release of the IRBEM library can be found at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6867552](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6867552). Thank you to N. Tsyganenko for the development of the external magnetic field models and their code, which are used within OTSO.

A wider thanks goes to the space physics community who, through the use of the original [OTSO](https://github.com/NLarsen15/OTSO), provided invaluable feedback, advice on improvements, and bug reporting. All discussions and advice have aided in the continual development and improvement of OTSO, allowing it to fulfil its aim of being a community-driven open-source tool. The lessons learned from the initial OTSO versions have been incorporated into OTSOpy. Dr. Chris Davis was also instrumental in the development of OTSOpy with his suggestion of incorporating OTSO into the [AniMARIE](https://github.com/ssc-maire/AniMAIRE-public) tool, initiating the package development and providing help by expanding functionality and bug fixing. My personal thanks to Dr. Sergey Koldobsky for lending me his MacBook for MacOS Fortran compilations, expanding the number of available operating systems for OTSOpy.
OTSO was developed at the University of Oulu as part of the Academy of Finland QUASARE project. I would like to thank my colleagues at the University and the Academy of Finland for supporting the work.
