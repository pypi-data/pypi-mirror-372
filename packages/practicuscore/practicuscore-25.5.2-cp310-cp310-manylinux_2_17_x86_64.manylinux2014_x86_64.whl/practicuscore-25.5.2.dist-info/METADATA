[Practicus AI](https://practicus.ai/) is an end-to-end Data Science platform, which works like a spreadsheet. It works for both technical and non-technical users. 

You can **explore and analyze** large amounts of raw data and find unique insights and patterns. 

Practicus AI allows you to easily **transform and prepare** data, and extend with coding only if necessary. 

You can create AI models using **AutoML** and **predict** the future with just a few clicks. When working with complex problems, 
you can share your experiments exported code with the data science team, so they can take it further without starting from scratch.

Several Practicus AI features work directly inside Spreadsheets, allowing you to bring more than 1 billion Spreadsheet 
users into your Data Science projects. 

If needed, you can click to generate the **data processing pipeline code**, and go to production with ease. 

Practicus AI **app is forever free**, and the cloud platform offers a **forever free tier** as well. 
If you need more cloud capacity, you can **pay as you go**, which shows as a line item in your cloud invoice. 
No commitments or credit card is needed.
