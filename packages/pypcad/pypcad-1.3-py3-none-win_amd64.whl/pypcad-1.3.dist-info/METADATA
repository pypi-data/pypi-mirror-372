# Python API For ARES Commander And OEMs

This library is designed to simplify the process of writing ActiveX scripts specifically for ARES Commander, which is a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, and its OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) versions. 

By using Python, developers can leverage its simplicity and flexibility to automate tasks within ARES Commander and its OEM variants. 

This library provides an interface between Python and the ActiveX technology used by ARES Commander, enabling developers to control various aspects of the CAD software programmatically. 

With this library, tasks such as drawing creation, editing, and manipulation can be automated, streamlining workflows and increasing productivity for users of ARES Commander and its OEM versions.

# Simple usage example:

```python
import PyPCAD.api as ac 

ares = ac.PyPCAD()

ares.AddText("HELLO",ac.Apoint(0,0,0),50)

ares.ZoomExtents()
print("Done.")
```
