# Hacka-Py - Python version of HackaGames<br /> An Hackable Games' Engine

**HackaGames** aims to be an open game engine dedicated to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Operational Research (OR) technics.
The philosophy of **HackaGames** is to permit developers to easily work in any language of its choice.
For that, the project is based on a communication protocol relying on *ZeroMQ* and is developed accordingly to [KISS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_KISS) (Keep It Stupid Simple) principle.
The main feature of this project is to permit the game, players and AIs to works on their own process potentially distributed over different machines.
In other terms, **HackaGames** implement a simple client/server architecture to permit _AI_ to take a seat on a game through a simple communication protocol.

**HackaGames** is seen as an API for game development.
