WICPy defines Python (>=v3.8) classes wrapping the COM interfaces, bringing access to their methods and coordinating the memory managed and unmanaged modes of the resources from either side.

The COM library must be initialized for each thread creating from scratch a new component by calling Initialize() and therefore uninitialized at the end by calling Uninitialize(), after having released all interfaces.

Bases of wrappers for Direct2D, Direct3D 11 and DXGI interfaces involved in interoperability with WIC are made available.
WICPy also gives access to the Windows Media Player photo library, as well as some Windows Shell Namespace resources.

Besides, the module facilitates the creation of custom COM interfaces, implementations and pxoxies/stubs using metaclasses. Factory classes can be registered in the registry and invoked using comserver.dll which must be placed in the same folder as wic.py.  
The DLL comserver.dll can be compiled from the source code comserver.c for example with MINGW64 with the command (the args must be set according to the path and installed version of python):  
  gcc -shared comserver.c -o comserver.dll -I "C:\Program Files\Python\include" -L "C:\Program Files\Python\libs" -l python3

The script test.py illustrates how to use the module through various applications.
