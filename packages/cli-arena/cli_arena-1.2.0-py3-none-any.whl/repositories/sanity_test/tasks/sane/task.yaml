name: "Sanity Test Task"
description: |
  Create a simple Python test file that verifies basic arithmetic operations.
  The test file should be created at 'tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py' and should include
  test functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

instructions: |
  1. Create a new Python test file at 'tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py'
  2. Write test functions for basic arithmetic operations:
     - test_addition: Verify that 1 + 1 equals 2
     - test_subtraction: Verify that 2 - 1 equals 1
     - test_multiplication: Verify that 2  2 equals 4
     - test_division: Verify that 4 / 2 equals 2
  3. Run the tests using pytest

files_to_modify:
  - tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py

success_criteria:
  - All test cases must pass
  - The test file must be properly formatted with correct Python syntax
  - The test file must be placed in the correct directory structure

difficulty: "easy"
estimated_time: "5m"
dependencies: ["pytest"]
