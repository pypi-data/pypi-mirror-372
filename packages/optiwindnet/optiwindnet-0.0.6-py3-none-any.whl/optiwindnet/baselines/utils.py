    """Edge length matrix for VRP-based solvers.
    It is assumed that the problem has been pre-scaled, such that multiplying
    all lengths by `scale` will place them within a numerically stable range.
    Length of return to depot from all nodes is set to 0 (i.e. Open-VRP).
    Order of nodes in the returned matrix is depot, clients (required by some
    VRP methods), which differs from interrarray order (i.e clients, depot).

    Parameters
    ----------
    A: NetworkX Graph
        Must contain graph attributes `R`, 'T', `VertexC` and 'd2roots'. If A
        has no edges, calculate lengths of the complete graph of A's nodes,
        otherwise only calculate lengths of A's edges and assign +inf to
        non-existing edges. A's edges must have the 'length' attribute.

    scale: float
        Factor to multiply all lengths by.

    Returns
    -------
    L, len_max:
        Matrix of lengths and maximum length value (below +inf).
