# mathfunctionize
An extensive Python library for math functions in advanced fields of math. Visit [upcoming.md](upcoming.md) for future functions to be added.

## Getting Started
---
Run ```pip install mathfunctionize``` to get started

Import the library into python file: ```from mathfunctionize import mathfunctionize```

Functions are able to be used by stating ```mathfunctionize.intendedFunction()``` and replacing ```intendedFunction()``` with the one of the avalible functions listed below.

## Operations:
---
```addition(a, b)``` - takes two numerical inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers

```subtraction(a, b)``` - takes two numerical inputs and returns the number minus the second number

```multiplication(a, b)``` - takes two numerical inputs and returns the product of the two numbers

```division(a, b)``` - takes two numerical inputs and returns the first number divided by the second number

```power(a, b)```

```modulo(a, b)```

```flatDivision(a, b)```

```factorial(x)```

## Mathematics
---
```absolute(x)```

```round(x, place)```

## Quantative Analysis
---
```localMinimum(arr)```

```localMaximum(arr)```

```globalMinimum(arr)```

```globalMaximum(arr)```

## Statistics
---
```mean(arr)```
