"""
Content reader for include directives.

Given a list of ``IncludeMetadata`` objects produced by the extractor, this
reader resolves the include paths, reads the referenced files, and prepares the
replacement text.  Each include block will receive a warning comment to
discourage manual edits to the generated region.

Relative paths are resolved relative to a base directory, which can be
specified via the ``base_dir`` argument or the ``README_WEAVER_BASE``
environment variable.  Absolute paths are used as‑is.
