              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# AngelCV

**AngelCV is an open-source, commercially-friendly computer vision library designed for ease of use, power, and extensibility.**

AngelCV is a project by [**Angel Protection System**](https://angelprotection.com/), a company at the forefront of safeguarding schools, hospitals, and other vital community spaces. They specialize in intelligent security and surveillance systems, including cutting-edge firearm detection technology that provides critical, real-time information to 911 and first responders, playing a vital role in saving lives.

Our mission is to provide cutting-edge deep learning models and tools that you can seamlessly integrate into your projects, whether for research, personal use, or commercial applications. All our code and pre-trained models are under the **Apache 2.0 License**, giving you the freedom to innovate without restrictive licensing.

_A note on our open-source commitment: Angel Protection System initially developed AngelCV to enhance its advanced computer vision capabilities for security applications. We are excited to share it with the open-source community to foster innovation and allow everyone to benefit from and contribute to its development._

## ✨ Why AngelCV?

- **Open & Free for Commercial Use**: Build your next big thing without worrying about licensing fees or restrictions. Our Apache 2.0 license covers both the library and our provided pre-trained models.
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: We start with robust implementations like YOLOv10 for object detection and plan to expand to other vision tasks (classification, segmentation, oriented bounding boxes) and model architectures.
- **Developer-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive API (see `ObjectDetectionModel` and `InferenceResult`) makes common tasks like training, inference, and evaluation straightforward.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customize model architectures, training parameters, and datasets using YAML-based configuration files.
- **Community Driven (Future)**: We aim to build a community around AngelCV.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

AngelCV will be available on PyPI. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install angelcv
```

Make sure you have PyTorch installed, as it's a primary dependency. You can find PyTorch installation instructions at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).

### Quick Start: Object Detection

Here's a simple example of how to load a pre-trained YOLOv10 model and perform inference on an image:

```python
from angelcv import ObjectDetectionModel

# Load a pre-trained YOLOv10n model (will download if not found locally)
# You can also specify a path to a local .ckpt or .pt file,
# or a .yaml configuration file to initialize a new model.
model = ObjectDetectionModel("yolov10n.ckpt")

# Perform inference on an image
# Source can be a file path, URL, PIL image, torch.Tensor, or numpy array.
results = model.predict("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Process and display results
for result in results:
    print(f"Found {len(result.boxes.xyxy)} objects.")
    # Access bounding boxes (various formats available, e.g., result.boxes.xyxy_norm)
    # Access confidences: result.boxes.confidences
    # Access class IDs: result.boxes.class_label_ids
    # Access class labels (if available): result.boxes.labels

    # Show the annotated image
    result.show()

    # Save the annotated image
    result.save("output_image.jpg")
```

## 🚧 Development Status

> **⚠️ Repository Under Heavy Development**
>
> AngelCV is actively being developed. While core functionality is stable, we're continuously improving and expanding features.

### ✅ **Stable & Ready to Use**

- **Object Detection**: Training, validation, testing, and inference are fully stable
- **YOLOv10 Integration**: Robust implementation with pre-trained models
- **Core API**: `ObjectDetectionModel` and `InferenceResult` interfaces
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based model and training configuration
- **Model Export**: ONNX, TensorRT, and other deployment formats

### 🔄 **Worning On**

- **Data Augmentation**: Expanding augmentation techniques to improve training performance on large datasets
- **Performance Optimization**: Addressing slightly below-expected performance on big datasets
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

### 📋 **Coming Soon (TODO)**

- **Image Segmentation**: Semantic and instance segmentation models
- **Oriented Bounding Boxes**: Support for rotated object detection
- **Classification Models**: Standalone image classification capabilities
- **Additional Architectures**: Beyond YOLOv10 (YOLOv9, DETR, etc.)
- **Advanced Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking tools
