# AngelCV

**AngelCV is an open-source, commercially-friendly computer vision library designed for ease of use, power, and extensibility.**

AngelCV is a project by [**Angel Protection System**](https://angelprotection.com/), a company at the forefront of safeguarding schools, hospitals, and other vital community spaces. They specialize in intelligent security and surveillance systems, including cutting-edge firearm detection technology that provides critical, real-time information to 911 and first responders, playing a vital role in saving lives.

Our mission is to provide cutting-edge deep learning models and tools that you can seamlessly integrate into your projects, whether for research, personal use, or commercial applications. All our code and pre-trained models are under the **Apache 2.0 License**, giving you the freedom to innovate without restrictive licensing.

_A note on our open-source commitment: Angel Protection System initially developed AngelCV to enhance its advanced computer vision capabilities for security applications. We are excited to share it with the open-source community to foster innovation and allow everyone to benefit from and contribute to its development._

## ‚ú® Why AngelCV?

- **Open & Free for Commercial Use**: Build your next big thing without worrying about licensing fees or restrictions. Our Apache 2.0 license covers both the library and our provided pre-trained models.
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: We start with robust implementations like YOLOv10 for object detection and plan to expand to other vision tasks (classification, segmentation, oriented bounding boxes) and model architectures.
- **Developer-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive API (see `ObjectDetectionModel` and `InferenceResult`) makes common tasks like training, inference, and evaluation straightforward.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customize model architectures, training parameters, and datasets using YAML-based configuration files.
- **Community Driven (Future)**: We aim to build a community around AngelCV.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

AngelCV will be available on PyPI. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install angelcv
```

Make sure you have PyTorch installed, as it's a primary dependency. You can find PyTorch installation instructions at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).

### Quick Start: Object Detection

Here's a simple example of how to load a pre-trained YOLOv10 model and perform inference on an image:

```python
from angelcv import ObjectDetectionModel

# Load a pre-trained YOLOv10n model (will download if not found locally)
# You can also specify a path to a local .ckpt or .pt file,
# or a .yaml configuration file to initialize a new model.
model = ObjectDetectionModel("yolov10n.ckpt")

# Perform inference on an image
# Source can be a file path, URL, PIL image, torch.Tensor, or numpy array.
results = model.predict("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Process and display results
for result in results:
    print(f"Found {len(result.boxes.xyxy)} objects.")
    # Access bounding boxes (various formats available, e.g., result.boxes.xyxy_norm)
    # Access confidences: result.boxes.confidences
    # Access class IDs: result.boxes.class_label_ids
    # Access class labels (if available): result.boxes.labels

    # Show the annotated image
    result.show()

    # Save the annotated image
    result.save("output_image.jpg")
```

## üöß Development Status
