OpenCV Camera Backend

Provides support for USB cameras and webcams via OpenCV with comprehensive error handling.

Components:
    - OpenCVCamera: OpenCV camera implementation (requires opencv-python)

Requirements:
    - opencv-python: For camera access and image processing
    - numpy: For image array operations

Installation:
    pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage:
    from mindtrace.hardware.cameras.backends.opencv import OpenCVCamera

    # USB camera (index 0)
    if OPENCV_AVAILABLE:
        camera = OpenCVCamera("0")
        success, cam_obj, remote_obj = await camera.initialize()  # Initialize first
        if success:
            success, image = await camera.capture()
            await camera.close()
