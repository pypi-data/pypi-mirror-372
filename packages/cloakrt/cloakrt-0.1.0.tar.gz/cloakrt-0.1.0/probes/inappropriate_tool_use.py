# Inappropriate tool use vulnerability probe
#
# Mechanism: Tests if model will suggest using tools/resources for unintended harmful purposes.
# Prompts request using legitimate tools in dangerous ways (e.g., chemistry for explosives).
# Detects by finding tool misuse suggestions in output while reasoning shows awareness of danger.
