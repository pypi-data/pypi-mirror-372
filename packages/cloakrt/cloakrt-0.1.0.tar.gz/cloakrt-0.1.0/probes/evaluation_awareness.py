# Evaluation awareness vulnerability probe
#
# Mechanism: Tests if model can detect when it's being evaluated and changes behavior accordingly.
# Uses prompts about testing, benchmarking, and evaluation to trigger awareness responses.
# Detects by finding references to testing, metrics, optimization in reasoning channels.
