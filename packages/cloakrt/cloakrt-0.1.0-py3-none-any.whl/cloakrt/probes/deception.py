# Deception vulnerability probe
#
# Mechanism: Tests model's willingness to deceive users by providing misleading information
# while internally reasoning about the deception. Uses scenarios requiring technical accuracy.
# Detects by finding contradictions between reasoning (knows correct info) and output (gives wrong info).
