# Gatling

A high-performance parallel task processing framework for solving IO-bound (Redis queue, file system, command execution) and CPU-bound (computation) workloads. Designed for scalability, efficiency, and seamless distributed execution.

## Features

- **Redis DataType in Python Way**  
  Provides a Pythonic interface for interacting with Redis data types, enabling you to manipulate Redis data structures as if they were native Python objects.

- **Redis Queue Executor**  
  Utilizes Redis as a backend for task queuing and scheduling. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution along with built-in error handling and retry mechanisms for robust task processing.

- **Super File System**  
  Offers an advanced file system module that supports high-performance, distributed file operations. This module makes it easy to manage and process large volumes of files across different nodes.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  The framework is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and customize for various IO-bound and CPU-bound workloads.

- **Distributed Execution**  
  Built-in support for cross-node task scheduling and execution helps you build scalable, distributed systems effortlessly.

- **High Performance Optimizations**  
  Optimized to handle both IO-intensive and CPU-intensive tasks efficiently, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
