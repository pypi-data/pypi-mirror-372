# Initialize with your preferred storage provider
storage_manager = BlobStorageManager(
    provider="local",  # or "aws", "azure", "gcp"
    config={
        "base_path": "/path/to/storage"  # Provider-specific configuration
    }
)

# Upload a file
async def upload_file():
    with open("example.txt", "rb") as f:
        await storage_manager.upload(
            file=f,
            destination="path/to/upload/example.txt"
        )

# Download a file
async def download_file():
    file_content = await storage_manager.download(
        source="path/to/download/example.txt"
    )
    with open("downloaded.txt", "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_content)
```
