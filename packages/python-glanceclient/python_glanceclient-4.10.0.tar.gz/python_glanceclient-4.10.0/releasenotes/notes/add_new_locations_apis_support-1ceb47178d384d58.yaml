    Add support for the new Glance ``Locations`` APIs

    - Add client support for newly added API,
      ``POST /v2/images/{image_id}/locations`` in Glance.
      New add location operation is allowed for service to service
      interaction, end users only when `http` store is enabled in
      deployment and images which are in ``queued`` state only.
      This api replaces the image-update (old location-add) mechanism
      for consumers like cinder and nova to address `OSSN-0090`_ and
      `OSSN-0065`_. This client change adds support of new shell command
      ``add-location`` and new client method ``add_image_location``.
    - Add support for newly added API,
      ``GET /v2/images/{image_id}/locations`` in Glance to fetch the
      locations associated to an image. This change adds new client method
      ``get_image_locations`` since this new get locations api is meant for
      service user only hence it is not exposed to the end user as a shell
      command.
