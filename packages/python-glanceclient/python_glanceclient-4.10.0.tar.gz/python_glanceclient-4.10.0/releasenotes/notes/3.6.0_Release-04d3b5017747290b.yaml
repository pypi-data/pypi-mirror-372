    This version of python-glanceclient introduces new commands ``usage``
    to fetch quota related usage information and ``cache-clear``,
    ``cache-delete``, ``cache-list`` and ``cache-queue`` for cache related
    operations.

features:
  - |
    Adds support for ``usage`` command which will report the usage
    of unified limits configured. The following commands have been added to
    the command line interface:

    * ``usage`` - Get quota usage information.

  - |
    Client support has been added for the new caching functionality
    introduced into Glance in this cycle. This feature is only available in
    the Images API version 2 when the caching middleware is enabled in the
    Glance service that the client is contacting. The following commands have
    been added to the command line interface:

    * ``cache-clear`` - Delete all the images from cache and queued for caching
    * ``cache-delete`` - Delete the specified image from cache or from the queued
      list

      caching
    * ``cache-queue`` - Queue specified image(s) for caching.

    Client side support has been added to fetch store specific configuration
    information. With sufficient permissions, this will display additional
    information about the stores.

  - |
    Client side support has been added to provide the facility of appending
    the tags while creating new multiple tags rather than overwriting the
    existing tags.
