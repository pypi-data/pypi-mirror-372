'''
    status: this is a port-in-progress from ts. Andreas' filter should be scanned for comparison
            object style makes it less useful, need filter for chain/pipe application

    system options:

        narration client --> temporalFilter service --> semanticShell --> db

        temporalFilter can be hosted in a pipe:
            1) as shown in ts
            2) as shown in python
            3) embedded in narration client
            4) embedded in semanticShell
        
        1) is probably the best as it leaves the client/user out of the problem
        2) allows the client/user to handle performance issues
        3) offload to thread while narration is ongoing is a good idea, except w.r.t load effects
        4) single point of loading limits bandwidth
        
    1) is target ==> this port on hold
