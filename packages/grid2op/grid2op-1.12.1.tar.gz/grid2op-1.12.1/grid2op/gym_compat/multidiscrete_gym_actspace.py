class __AuxMultiDiscreteActSpace:
    """
    This class allows to convert a grid2op action space into a gymnasium "MultiDiscrete". This means that the action are
    labeled, and instead of describing the action itself, you provide only its ID.

    .. note::
        This action space is particularly suited for represented discrete actions.

        It is possible to represent continuous actions with it. In that case, the continuous actions are "binarized"
        thanks to the :class:`ContinuousToDiscreteConverter`. Feel free to consult its documentation for
        more information.

    In this case it will extract all the features in all the action with:

    - "set_line_status": `n_line` dimensions, each containing 3 choices "DISCONNECT", "DONT AFFECT", "FORCE CONNECTION"
      and affecting the powerline status (connected / disconnected)
    - "change_line_status":  `n_line` dimensions, each containing 2 elements "CHANGE", "DONT CHANGE" and
      affecting the powerline status (connected / disconnected)
    - "set_bus": `dim_topo` dimensions, each containing 4 choices: "DISCONNECT", "DONT AFFECT", "CONNECT TO BUSBAR 1",
      or "CONNECT TO BUSBAR 2", "CONNECT TO BUSBAR 3", ... and affecting to which busbar an object is connected
    - "change_bus": `dim_topo` dimensions, each containing 2 choices: "CHANGE", "DONT CHANGE" and affect
      to which busbar an element is connected
    - "redispatch": `sum(env.gen_redispatchable)` dimensions, each containing a certain number of choices depending on the value
      of the keyword argument `nb_bins["redispatch"]` (by default 7).
    - "curtail": `sum(env.gen_renewable)` dimensions, each containing a certain number of choices depending on the value
      of the keyword argument `nb_bins["curtail"]` (by default 7). This is
      the "conversion to discrete action"
      of the curtailment action.
    - "curtail_mw": `sum(env.gen_renewable)` dimensions, completely equivalent to "curtail" for this representation. 
      This is the "conversion to discrete action" of the curtailment action.
    - "set_storage": `n_storage` dimensions, each containing a certain number of choices depending on the value
      of the keyword argument `nb_bins["set_storage"]` (by default 7). This is the "conversion to discrete action"
      of the action on storage units.
    - "raise_alarm": TODO
    - "raise_alert": TODO


    We offer some extra customization, with the keywords:

    - "sub_set_bus": `n_sub` dimension. This type of representation encodes each different possible combination
      of elements that are possible at each substation. The choice at each component depends on the element connected
      at this substation. Only configurations that will not lead to straight game over will be generated.
    - "sub_change_bus": `n_sub` dimension. Same comment as for "sub_set_bus"
    - "one_sub_set": 1 single dimension. This type of representation differs from the previous one only by the fact
      that each step you can perform only one single action on a single substation (so unlikely to be illegal).
    - "one_sub_change": 1 single dimension. Same as above.
    - "one_line_set": 1 single dimension. In this type of representation, you have one dimension with `1 + 2 * n_line`
      elements: first is "do nothing", then next elements control the force connection or disconnection
      of the powerlines (new in version 1.10.0)
    - "one_line_change": 1 single dimension. In this type of representation, you have `1 + n_line` possibility
      for this element. First one is "do nothing" then it controls the change of status of 
      any given line (new in version 1.10.0).

    .. warning::

        We recommend to use either "set" or "change" way to look at things (**ie** either you want to target
        a given state -in that case use "sub_set_bus", "line_set_status", "one_sub_set", or "set_bus" __**OR**__ you
        prefer
        reasoning in terms of "i want to change this or that" in that case use "sub_change_bus",
        "line_change_status", "one_sub_change" or "change_bus".

        Combining a "set" and "change" on the same element will most likely lead to an "ambiguous action". Indeed
        what grid2op can do if you "tell element A to go to bus 1" and "tell the same element A to switch to bus 2 if it was
        to 1 and to move to bus 1 if it was on bus 2". It's not clear at all (hence the "ambiguous").

        No error will be thrown if you mix this, this is your absolute right, be aware it might not
        lead to the result you expect though.

    .. note::

        The arguments "set_bus", "sub_set_bus" and "one_sub_set" will all perform "set_bus" actions. The only
        difference if "how you represent these actions":

        - In "set_bus" each component represent a single element of the grid. When you sample an action
          with this keyword you will possibly change all the elements of the grid at once (this is likely to
          be illega). Nothing prevents you to perform "weird" stuff, for example disconnecting a load or a generator
          (which is straight game over) or having a load or a generator that will be "alone" on a busbar (which
          will also lead to a straight game over). You can do anything with it, but as always "A great power
          comes with a great responsibility".
        - In "sub_set_bus" each component represent a substation of the grid. When you sample an action
          from this, you will possibly change all the elements of the grid at once (because you can act
          on all the substation at the same time). As opposed to "set_bus" however this constraint the action
          space to "action that will not lead directly to a game over", in practice.
        - In "one_sub_set": the single component represent the whole grid. When you sample an action
          with this, you will sample a single action acting on a single substation. You will not be able to act
          on multiple substation with this.

        For this reason, we also do not recommend using only one of these arguments and only provide
        only one of "set_bus", "sub_set_bus" and "one_sub_set". Again, no error will be thrown if you mix them
        but be warned that the resulting behaviour might not be what you expect.

    .. warning::

        The same as above holds for "change_bus", "sub_change_bus" and "one_sub_change": Use only one of these !

    .. danger::
        The keys `set_bus` and `change_bus` does not have the same meaning between this representation of the
        action and the DiscreteActSpace.
    .. warning::
        Depending on the presence absence of gymnasium and gym packages this class might behave differently.
        
        In grid2op we tried to maintain compatibility both with gymnasium (newest) and gym (legacy, 
        no more maintained) RL packages. The behaviour is the following:
        
        - :class:`MultiDiscreteActSpace` will inherit from gymnasium if it's installed 
          (in this case it will be :class:`MultiDiscreteActSpaceGymnasium`), otherwise it will
          inherit from gym (and will be exactly :class:`MultiDiscreteActSpaceLegacyGym`)
        - :class:`MultiDiscreteActSpaceGymnasium` will inherit from gymnasium if it's available and never from
          from gym
        - :class:`MultiDiscreteActSpaceLegacyGym` will inherit from gym if it's available and never from
          from gymnasium
        
        See :ref:`gymnasium_gym` for more information
        
    Examples
    --------
    If you simply want to use it you can do:

    .. code-block:: python

        import grid2op
        env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name
        env = grid2op.make(env_name)

        from grid2op.gym_compat import GymEnv, MultiDiscreteActSpace
        gym_env = GymEnv(env)

        gym_env.action_space = MultiDiscreteActSpace(env.action_space)

    You can select the attribute you want to keep, for example:

    .. code-block:: python

        gym_env.action_space = MultiDiscreteActSpace(env.observation_space,
                                                     attr_to_keep=['redispatch', "curtail", "sub_set_bus"])

    You can also apply some basic transformation when you "discretize" continuous action

    .. code-block:: python

        gym_env.action_space = MultiDiscreteActSpace(env.observation_space,
                                                     attr_to_keep=['redispatch', "curtail", "sub_set_bus"],
                                                     nb_bins={"redispatch": 3, "curtail": 17},
                                                     )

    By default it is "discretized" in 7 different "bins". The more "bins" there will be, the more "precise"
    you can be in your control, but the higher the dimension of the action space.
