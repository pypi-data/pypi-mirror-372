    "\n",
    "For the organisation of this notebook we decided to first detail features closer to grid2op to go later on \"higher level\" feature that are closer to \"standard\" gym representation (eg `Box` and `Discrete` space).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the closer you are to grid2op the more grid2op feature you can use. For example, in gym environment, it is not possible to use the \"simulate\" function (remember, this function allow to use a simulator that has a behaviour close to the one of the environment) at all. Also, grid2op observation and action comes with a lot of different feature (capacity to add them, to retrieve the graph of the grid etc.) which is not possible to use directly in gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this notebook is organized as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Convert it to a gym environment](#Convert-it-to-a-gym-environment): basic use of the `gym_compat` grid2op module allowing to convert a grid2op environment to a gym environment.\n",
    "- [Action space](#Action-space): basic usage of the action space, by removing redundant feature (`gym_env.observation_space.ignore_attr`) or transforming feature from a continuous space to a discrete space (`ContinuousToDiscreteConverter`)\n",
    "- [Observation space](#Observation-space): basic usage of the observation space, by removing redunddant features (`keep_only_attr`) or to scale the data on between a certain range (`ScalerAttrConverter`)\n",
    "- [Making the grid2op agent](#Making-the-grid2op-agent) explains how to make a grid2op agent once trained. Note that a more \"agent focused\" view is provided in the notebook [04_TrainingAnAgent](04_TrainingAnAgent.ipynb) !\n",
    "\n",
    "To dive deeper and with proper \"hands on\", you can refer to one of the following notebooks that uses real RL frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) RLLIB: see notebook [11_ray_integration](./11_ray_integration.ipynb) for more information about RLLIB\n",
    "2) Stable baselines: see notebook [11_ray_integration](./11_stable_baselines3_integration.ipynb) for more information about stables-baselines3\n",

    "## 0) Recommended initial steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split the environment into training, validation and test\n",
    "\n",
    "As in other machine learning tasks, we highly recommend, before even trying to train an agent, to split the \"chronics\" (ie the episode data) into 3 datasets:\n",
    "- \"train\" use to train the agent\n",
    "- \"val\" use to validate the hyper parameters\n",
    "- \"test\" at which you would look only once to report the agent performance in a scientific paper (for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid2op lets you do that with relative ease:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import grid2op\n",
    "env_name = \"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\"  # or any other...\n",
    "env = grid2op.make(env_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# extract 1% of the \"chronics\" to be used in the validation environment. The other 99% will\n",
    "# be used for test\n",
    "nm_env_train, nm_env_val, nm_env_test = env.train_val_split_random(pct_val=1., pct_test=1.)\n",
    "\n",

    "print(f\"The name of the training environment is \\\\\"{nm_env_train}\\\\\"\")\n",
    "print(f\"The name of the validation environment is \\\\\"{nm_env_val}\\\\\"\")\n",
    "print(f\"The name of the test environment is \\\\\"{nm_env_test}\\\\\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "env = grid2op.make(env_name+\"train\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be carefull, on windows you might run into issues. Don't hesitate to have a look at the documentation of this funciton if this the case (see https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment.html#grid2op.Environment.Environment.train_val_split and https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment.html#grid2op.Environment.Environment.train_val_split_random)\n",

    "env_name = \"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\"  # or any other name\n",

    "\n",
    "env.generate_classes()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, each time you want to reload the same environment, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import grid2op\n",
    "env_name = SAME NAME AS ABOVE\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known to solve bug related to multi processing, but also to reduce the amount of RAM taken (in some cases) as well as creation time (in some cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid2op documentation is full of details to \"optimize\" the number of steps you can do per seconds. This number can rise from a few dozen per seconds to around a thousands per seconds with proper care.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly encouraged you to leverage all the possibilities which includes (but are not limited to):\n",
    "- using \"lightsim2grid\" as a backend for a 10-15x speed up in the \"env.step(...)\" function\n",
