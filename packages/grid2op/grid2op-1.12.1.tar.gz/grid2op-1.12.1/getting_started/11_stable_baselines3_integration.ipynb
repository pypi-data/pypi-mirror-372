    "<font color='red'> It is unlikely that \"simply\" using a RL algorithm on a grid2op environment will lead to good results for the vast majority of environments.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make RL algorithms work with more or less sucess you might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1) ajust the observation space: in particular selecting the right information for your agent. Too much information\n",
    "     and the size of the observation space will blow up and your agent will not learn anything. Not enough\n",
    "     information and your agent will not be able to capture anything.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  2) customize the action space: dealing with both discrete and continuous values is often a challenge. So maybe you      want to focus on only one type of action. And in all cases, try to still reduce the amount of actions your\n",
    "     agent \n",
    "     can perform. Indeed, for \"larger\" grids (118 substations, as a reference the french grid counts more than 6.000\n",
    "     such substations...) and by limiting 2 busbars per substation (as a reference, for some subsations, you have more\n",
    "     than 12 such \"busbars\") your agent will have the opportunity to choose between more than 60.000 different discrete\n",
    "     actions each steps. This is way too large for current RL algorithm as far as we know (and proposed environment are\n",
    "     small in comparison to real one)\n",
    "     \n",
    "  3) customize the reward: the default reward might not work great for you. Ultimately, what TSO's or ISO's want is\n",
    "     to operate the grid safely, as long as possible with a cost as low as possible. This is of course really hard to\n",
    "     catch everything in one single reward signal. Customizing the reward is also really important because the \"do\n",
    "     nothing\" policy often leads to really good results (much better than random actions) which makes exploration \n",
    "     different actions...). So you kind of want to incentivize your agent to perform some actions at some point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4) use fast simulator: even if you target an industrial application with industry grade simulators, we still would\n",
    "     advise you to use (at early stage of training at least) fast simulator for the vast majority of the training\n",
    "     process and then maybe to fine tune on better one.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5) combine RL with some heuristics: it's super easy to implement things like \"if there is no issue, then do\n",
    "     nothing\". This can be quite time consuming to learn though. Don't hesitate to check out the \"l2rpn-baselines\"\n",
    "     repository for already \"kind of working\" heuristics\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we define a custom environment (that will internally use the `GymEnv` grid2op class) that is needed for ray / rllib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in order to work with ray / rllib you need to define a custom wrapper on top of the GymEnv wrapper. You then have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- self._g2op_env which is the default grid2op environment, receiving grid2op Action and producing grid2op Observation.\n",
    "- self._gym_env which is a the grid2op defined `gymnasium Environment` that cannot be directly used with ray / rllib\n",
    "- `Grid2opEnv` which is a the wrapper on top of `self._gym_env` to make it usable with ray / rllib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray / rllib expects the gymnasium environment to inherit from `gymnasium.Env` and to be initialized with a given configuration. This is why you need to create the `Grid2opEnv` wrapper on top of `GymEnv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initialization of `Grid2opEnv`, the `env_config` variable is a dictionary that can take as key-word arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `backend_cls` : what is the class of the backend. If not provided, it will use `LightSimBackend` from the `lightsim2grid` package\n",
    "- `backend_options`: what options will be used to create the backend for your environment. Your backend will be created by calling\n",
    "   `backend_cls(**backend_options)`, for example if you want to build `LightSimBackend(detailed_info_for_cascading_failure=False)` you can pass `{\"backend_cls\": LightSimBackend, \"backend_options\": {\"detailed_info_for_cascading_failure\": False}}`\n",
    "- `env_name` : name of the grid2op environment you want to use, by default it uses `\"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\"`\n",
    "- `env_is_test` : whether to add `test=True` when creating the grid2op environment (if `env_is_test` is True it will add `test=True` when calling `grid2op.make(..., test=True)`) otherwise it uses `test=False`\n",
    "- `obs_attr_to_keep` : in this wrapper we only allow your agent to see a Box as an observation. This parameter allows you to control which attributes of the grid2op observation will be present in the agent observation space. By default it's `[\"rho\", \"p_or\", \"gen_p\", \"load_p\"]` which is \"kind of random\" and is probably not suited for every agent.\n",
    "- `act_type` : controls the type of actions your agent will be able to perform. Already coded in this notebook are:\n",
    "   - `\"discrete\"` to use a `Discrete` action space\n",
    "   - `\"box\"` to use a `Box` action space\n",
    "   - `\"multi_discrete\"` to use a `MultiDiscrete` action space\n",
    "- `act_attr_to_keep` :  that allows you to customize the action space. If not provided, it defaults to:\n",
    "  - `[\"set_line_status_simple\", \"set_bus\"]` if `act_type` is `\"discrete\"` \n",
    "  - `[\"redispatch\", \"set_storage\", \"curtail\"]` if `act_type` is `\"box\"` \n",
    "  - `[\"one_line_set\", \"one_sub_set\"]` if `act_type` is `\"multi_discrete\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add more customization, for example the reward function, the parameters of the environment etc. etc. feel free to get inspired by this code and extend it. Any PR on this regard is more than welcome."
