class CompleteObservation(BaseObservation):
    """
    This class represent a complete observation, where everything on the powergrid can be observed without
    any noise.

    This is the only :class:`BaseObservation` implemented (and used) in Grid2Op. Other type of observation, for other
    usage can of course be implemented following this example.

    It has the same attributes as the :class:`BaseObservation` class. Only one is added here.

    For a :class:`CompleteObservation` the unique representation as a vector is:
