# Baseball Stats MCP Server - Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Built

I've successfully created a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for advanced baseball pitcher statistics and analytics. This server goes far beyond basic stats, providing deep insights into pitching performance through advanced metrics, pitch analysis, and interactive visualizations.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Pitching Analytics
- **Traditional Stats**: ERA, WHIP, K/9, BB/9, FIP, xFIP, BABIP
- **Pitch Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of pitch types, velocities, and movement
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Whiff rate, chase rate, barrel percentage, contact quality
- **Pitch Sequencing**: Analysis of pitch patterns and count-specific tendencies

### 2. Interactive Visualizations
- **Movement Charts**: Horizontal vs. vertical pitch movement analysis
- **Velocity Charts**: Speed distribution by pitch type
- **Location Charts**: Strike zone mapping and command analysis
- **Heatmap Charts**: Pitch location density patterns

### 3. Data Integration
- **MLB API**: Ready for real-time statistics (when API key is provided)
- **Firecrawl**: Web scraping for news and analysis
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive sample data for testing and demonstration

## Available Tools

The server provides 7 powerful tools:

1. **`get_pitcher_basic_stats`** - Comprehensive pitching statistics
2. **`get_pitch_breakdown`** - Detailed pitch type analysis
3. **`get_pitch_efficiency_metrics`** - Advanced efficiency metrics
4. **`generate_pitch_plot`** - Interactive visualization charts
5. **`get_pitcher_comparison`** - Multi-pitcher analysis
6. **`get_pitch_sequence_analysis`** - Pitch sequencing patterns
7. **`scrape_pitcher_news`** - Latest news and analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Async MCP Server**: Built using the official MCP Python library
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated methods for each tool
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback to mock data
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and validation

### Dependencies
- **Core**: MCP server framework, requests, pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts, matplotlib/seaborn for static plots
- **Data Processing**: Advanced data manipulation and statistical analysis
- **Web Scraping**: Firecrawl integration for news and analysis

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: MLB API for official statistics
- **Secondary**: Firecrawl for web content
- **Fallback**: Rich mock data for testing and demonstration

## Advanced Metrics Explained

### Contact Quality
- **Whiff Rate**: Percentage of swings that miss
- **Chase Rate**: Out-of-zone swing percentage
- **Barrel Percentage**: Optimal launch angle/exit velocity
- **Hard Hit Rate**: High-velocity contact percentage

### Pitch Effectiveness
- **Zone Rate**: Strike zone command
- **First Pitch Strike Rate**: First-pitch effectiveness
- **CSW%**: Called Strike + Whiff percentage
- **O-Swing% vs Z-Swing%**: Out-of-zone vs in-zone swing rates

## Visualization Capabilities

### Chart Types
1. **Movement Charts**: Show how pitches break and move through the air
2. **Velocity Charts**: Display speed consistency and range by pitch type
3. **Location Charts**: Map pitch locations in the strike zone
4. **Heatmap Charts**: Reveal preferred locations and tendencies

### Interactive Features
- Hover information for each data point
- Color-coded pitch types
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Export to various formats

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```
Get the basic pitching statistics for Jacob deGrom in the 2024 season
