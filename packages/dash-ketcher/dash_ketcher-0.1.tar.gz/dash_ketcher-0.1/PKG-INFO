and can be adapted to other systems or conda-based installation.

1. Create a local environment

   This step is optional but highly recommended to avoid conflicts with the base environment.

      $ pip install git+https://dash_ketcher
      ```

3. Download Ketcher

   Download Ketcher's standalone version >= 3.2 and add it to your Dash project, e.g. in assets/

4. Adapt & use the code

   * Using the provided exemple
