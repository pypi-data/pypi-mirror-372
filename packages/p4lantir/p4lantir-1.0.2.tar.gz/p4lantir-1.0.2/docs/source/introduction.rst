Introduction
============


**p4lantir** is a simple tool to perform Man-in-the-Middle over TCP using ARP spoofing, allowing to intercept, drop, forward and see TCP flows.

This project is intended to be relatively simple, making simple future contributions for new features/bug fix.


This is only source-code documentation, for usage please see the README of the `official repos <https://github.com/acmo0/p4lantir>`_.
