## Background

Statistics Norway is the national statistics agency in Norway. We are building a new production system in the cloud and moving towards a modern architecture based on open source technologies.

**Time series** play a key role in the statistics production process.

Our mission comes with strict requirements for transparency and data quality. Some are mandated by law, others stem from commitment to international standards.

The data itself has a wide variety, but time resolution and publishing frequencies are typically low. While volumes are sometimes significant, they are far from extreme. Quality and reliability is by far more important than latency. This shifts the focus towards process and data control.

This libarary came out of a PoC to demonstrate how key functionality could be provided in alignment with architecture decisions and process model requirements.

- At the core is storage with performant read and write, search and filtering of the time series data
- Good descriptive metadata is key to findability
- A wide selection of math and statistics libraries is key for calculations and models
- Visualisation tools play a role both in ad hoc and routine inspection and quality control
- Workflow integration with automation and process monitoring help keeping consistent quality
- Data lineage and process metadata is essential for quality control

It is constructed to be an abstraction between the storage and automation layers and the statistics production code. providing a way forward while postponing some technical choices.

## Feature summary

The core of the library is the `Dataset` class. Datasets consist of one or more series. Series in a set should be of the same type and should come from the same process.

All series in a set being of the same type and otherwise complying with the underlying [information model](docs/info-model.md) simplifies the implementation of storage, descriptive metadata and search and enables key calculation features:

- Since each series is represented as a column vector in a dataset matrix, *linear algebra* is readily available. Datasets can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided with each other and dataframes, matrices, vectors (untested) and scalars according to normal rules.
- *Time algebra* features allow up- and downsamliong that make use of the date columns. Basic time aggregation:
`Dataset.groupby('quarter', 'sum'|'mean'|'auto')`

- *Metadata calculations* uses the descriptions of the individual series for calculations ranging from simple things like unit conversions to using relations between entities in tag values to group series for aggregation.

It is not a strict requirement that all series in a set are written at the same time, but it tends to simplify [workflows](docs/workflow.md) a lot if they are.

The `io module` connects the dataset to helper class(es) that takes care of reading and writing data. This structure abstracts away the IO mechanics, so that the user do not need to know about implementation details, but only the _information model meaning_ of the choices made. Also, although the current implementation uses pyarrow and parquet data structures under the hood, by replacing the io-module, a database could be used instead.
