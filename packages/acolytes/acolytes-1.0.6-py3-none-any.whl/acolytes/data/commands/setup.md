description: ♾️  Setup project with Acolytes for Claude Code | Optional: --update
---

## ⚡ MANDATORY COMMAND FLOW

This system provides intelligent project setup with Acolytes for Claude Code's +50 specialized agents, supporting both existing projects and new project creation from expert consultation.

## Usage

```
/setup          # Initial complete setup for new projects OR existing projects
/setup --update # Update existing setup (new modules, refresh agents)
```

## 🚨 **MANDATORY EXECUTION RULE**

**PARALLEL EXECUTION = ONE MESSAGE WITH MULTIPLE TASK CALLS**

When this document says "parallel execution" or "agents (parallel)" it means:

- ✅ ONE single message with multiple Task calls
- ❌ NOT separate sequential messages

**Correct Example - ONE MESSAGE with multiple Task calls:**

```
Claude's single message contains:
• Task(@setup.codebase, prompt="Analyze /src/ directory and create architecture.md")
• Task(@setup.context, prompt="Analyze README and create vision.md")
• Task(@setup.infrastructure, prompt="Analyze configs and create team-preferences.md")
```

**All three Task calls in the SAME message - never separate messages.**

### **IMMUTABLE RULES – NO EXCEPTIONS**

1. **NEVER** analyze without creating documentation
2. **ALWAYS** create Database & MCP first (Phase 1)
3. **ALWAYS** create ALL required files and documentation
4. **NEVER** ask whether to create — just create
5. **ALL** documentation, code, comments, SQLite in English
6. **ALWAYS** use MULTIPLE TASK CALLS IN ONE MESSAGE for parallel execution

## 🎯 UNIFIED FLOW FOR BOTH PROJECT TYPES

### 1️⃣ **PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT & DATABASE SETUP**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: Validate the development environment, create the SQLite database with all required tables, and configure MCP connection. Follow the steps below to establish the complete system foundation.

````yaml
ENVIRONMENT_CHECK:
  - Execute: uv run python ~/.claude/scripts/environment_check.py
  - Validates: Python 3.8+, Git 2.0+, Node 18+, uv package manager
  - Creates environment report in .claude/project/environment-status.md
  - Auto-fixes common issues where possible

DATABASE_AND_MCP:
  1. Initialize database schema:
    - Execute: cat ~/.claude/scripts/init_db.sql | sqlite3 .claude/memory/project.db
    - Database will auto-create: agents_catalog (52 agents), jobs table with initial job, sessions, messages, etc.
    - Initial job 'Project Setup' automatically created with high priority
    - All tables, indexes, triggers, and constraints ready

  2. Configure MCP SQLite:
    - Run: uv run python ~/.claude/scripts/setup_mcp.py
    - User may need to restart Claude Code at the end of SETUP

  3. Initialize code-index MCP silently (NO COMMENTARY):
    - Execute: mcp__code-index__set_project_path(project_root)
    - Effect: enables faster searches for setup agents
    - Do NOT announce or comment on this indexing
    - Setup agents will use the index automatically
---

### 2️⃣ **PHASE 2: ANALYSIS & DOCUMENTATION**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: For existing projects, invoke the four setup agents in PARALLEL to analyze and document the project. For new projects, conduct the SMART REQUIREMENTS INTERVIEW following the conditional system, skip rules, and validation rules EXACTLY as specified - this interview adapts based on user type and project maturity. Study the interview system carefully before starting.

SPECIALIST_CONSULTATION:
  process: Claude analyzes all answers from requirements-interview.md
  action: Consult relevant specialists based on responses
  execution:
    - Use Task tool for PARALLEL consultation when specialists are independent
    - Use sequential if one specialist's response is needed for another's question
    - Apply logic to determine dependencies between consultations
  examples:
    - "React + PostgreSQL + Auth0" → @frontend.react, @database.postgres, @service.auth (parallel)
    - "Vue + MongoDB + Stripe" → @frontend.vue, @database.mongodb, @business.payment (parallel)
  storage: Append specialist recommendations to requirements-interview.md

PLAN_STRATEGY_ORGANIZATION:
  agent: @plan.strategy
  input: All interview answers + specialist recommendations
  output:
    - Complete project plan with phases and timeline
    - Same 6 documentation files in .claude/project/
    - Jobs created in SQLite database
    - Roadmap.md fully populated with executable phases
```

---

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: After Phase 2, @setup.infrastructure will report any missing dependencies (🚨 MISSING DEPENDENCIES).
If dependencies are missing (npm install, Docker, database clients), ask the user for permission to install them.
Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until critical dependencies are installed or user explicitly says to skip.

---

### 3️⃣ **PHASE 3: CLAUDE.MD CREATION**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: Generate a customized CLAUDE.md file using the template and documentation from Phase 2. Fill all template placeholders with project-specific information following the specifications below.

```yaml
CLAUDE_MD_GENERATION:
  source: Aggregated information from Phase 2
  template: ~/.claude/resources/templates/claude-template.md
  where create the CLAUDE.md: in the project root

  context_lite_generation:
    existing_projects: "{{context_lite}} → generated by @setup.context during Phase 2 analysis"
    new_projects: "{{context_lite}} → generated by Claude from interview + specialist recommendations"
    format: "3-4 paragraph executive summary (200-300 words max)"
    content:
      - "Project purpose and core value proposition"
      - "Key technical decisions and architecture approach"
      - "Current development phase and priorities"
      - "Critical constraints or special considerations"

  roadmap_handling:
    existing_projects: "{{roadmap_summary}} resolved in Phase 6 based on user roadmap decision"
    new_projects: "{{roadmap_summary}} from plan.strategy generated roadmap.md"

  user_placeholders:
    - {{project_maturity}} → from PROJECT_MATURITY_CLASSIFICATION
    - {{project_maturity_description}} → expanded description of maturity level
    - {{user_exp_code}} → from USER_CLASSIFICATION
    - {{user_exp_code_description}} → expanded description of user type
    - {{interaction_style}} → derived from user_exp_code (simple/technical language)
    - {{technical_depth}} → derived from user_exp_code (high/low technical detail)
    - {{decision_making_approach}} → derived from user_exp_code (autonomous/collaborative)

  project_placeholders:
    - {{project_name}} → from area 1 (Core Product Identity)
    - {{project_description}} → from vision.md summary
    - {{project_domain}} → detected from areas 1-2 (fintech, healthcare, etc.)
    - {{target_users}} → from area 1 (Core Product Identity)
    - {{tech_stack}} → from architecture.md primary technologies
    - {{architecture_approach}} → from architecture.md (monolith/microservices/etc.)
    - {{database_choice}} → from area 3 + specialist consultation
    - {{hosting_platform}} → from area 9 + specialist recommendations

  context_placeholder:
    - {{context_lite}} → executive summary (3-4 paragraphs, 200-300 words)

  documentation_summaries:
    - {{vision_summary}} → 1-line summary from vision.md
    - {{architecture_summary}} → 1-line summary from architecture.md
    - {{roadmap_summary}} → conditional: from roadmap.md if exists, else "resolved in Phase 6 based on roadmap decision"
    - {{tech_decisions_summary}} → 1-line summary from technical-decisions.md
    - {{team_preferences_summary}} → 1-line summary from team-preferences.md
    - {{project_context_summary}} → 1-line summary from project-context.md

  agent_placeholders:
    - {{agents}} → planned/detected acolytes array
    - {{agent_example}} → primary agent for project domain
    - {{first_agent}}, {{second_agent}}, {{third_agent}} → example agents for parallel execution
```

### 4️⃣ **PHASE 4: JOBS & AGENT CREATION**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: Invoke the acolytes-creator specialist to create acolyte agents for each detected or planned module. The specialist handles template filling, file creation, and database registration. Follow the process below based on project type.

#### **FOR EXISTING PROJECTS**

```yaml
ACOLYTE_CREATION:
  - Create project-specific agents based on detected modules
  - execution: MULTIPLE TASK CALLS IN ONE MESSAGE with @setup.acolytes-creator
  - Example: acolyte.api, acolyte.auth, acolyte.frontend

MODULE_DIVISION_RULES:
  - Single agent: modules with ≤30 files
  - Multiple agents: modules with >30 files split into submodule agents
  - Submodule agent examples: acolyte.api-auth, acolyte.api-endpoints, acolyte.rag-retrieval, acolyte.rag-indexing
  - Naming pattern: acolyte.[module]-[submodule]

AGENT_STRUCTURE:
  location: .claude/agents/acolyte.[module].md or .claude/agents/acolyte.[module]-[submodule].md
  creation: Claude delegates to @setup.acolytes-creator with module/submodule information
  memory_initialization: Agents create their own 14 memory records when first executed
```

#### **FOR NEW PROJECTS**

```yaml
PLAN_EXECUTION:
  - Create acolytes based on planned architecture
  - Agent creation guided by plan.strategy module structure and component boundaries
  - execution: MULTIPLE TASK CALLS IN ONE MESSAGE with @setup.acolytes-creator

MODULE_DIVISION_RULES:
  - Apply same 30-file rule for planned modules
  - Submodule agent creation: acolyte.api-auth, acolyte.payment-processing, acolyte.user-profile
```

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Restart Required After Phase 4

**CRITICAL**: Tell user: "Exit Claude CLI (CTRL+C twice), then write in Terminal `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -c`"
**EXPLAIN**: The `-c` flag resumes this same conversation where we left off (not a new session)
**WAIT**: For user confirmation before continuing to Phase 5. This restart is to integrate the acolytes into my system

### 5️⃣ **PHASE 5: DEEP ANALYSIS & INITIALIZATION**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: Invoke all created acolytes in parallel batches of 10 maximum. For existing projects, acolytes analyze their modules and populate memories with discovered information. For new projects, acolytes populate memories with planned architecture documentation. Each acolyte follows their internal template instructions.

```yaml
ACOLYTE_ACTIVATION:
  existing_projects:
    - Claude invokes all acolytes in parallel (max 10 per batch)
    - Each acolyte performs deep analysis of their assigned module
    - Fill their 14 memory records with comprehensive knowledge
    - Update agents_memory table in SQLite with discovered information

  new_projects:
    - Claude invokes acolytes to review .claude/project/ documentation
    - Acolytes populate memories with planned architecture and expectations
    - Set up knowledge base for future module implementation
    - Prepare memory structures for development phase
```

### 6️⃣ **PHASE 6: FINALIZATION**

**WHAT YOU (CLAUDE) MUST DO**: Confirm successful setup completion and present a comprehensive system summary. For existing projects, guide the user through roadmap decisions explaining the job system. For new projects, prepare for development phase. Follow the finalization steps below understanding that the system ALWAYS requires an active job.

```yaml
COMPLETION_SUMMARY:
  - Confirm all documentation created in .claude/project/
  - Verify SQLite database populated with agents and memories
  - Present system summary to user
  - List available agents with their expertise areas
  - Show next steps for development

JOB_SYSTEM_CRITICAL_RULES:
  - "'Acolyte for Claude Code' CANNOT function without an active job"
  - "Each job should contain 4-5 sessions maximum for optimal context"
  - "After 2+ months in one job, context window becomes problematic"
  - "Jobs group related work sessions for better memory persistence"
  - "NEVER close a job without opening another"

ROADMAP_DECISION:
  existing_projects:
    prompt: "Setup complete! What's your approach for this project?"
    options:
      no_roadmap: "Let's work organically - no structured roadmap needed"
      create_roadmap: "I want to plan objectives and create a development roadmap"

    no_roadmap_action:
      - Create roadmap.md with: "[X] NO STRUCTURED ROADMAP FOR THIS PROJECT, FOR NOW."
      - Keep setup job active (system REQUIRES active job - fundamental rule)
      - EXPLAIN to user:
        * "The system uses jobs to organize work and maintain context between sessions"
        * "Each job should contain ~3-4 sessions to avoid context overflow"
        * "You can create new jobs anytime - just tell me what you want to work on"
        * "Example: 'Create a job for implementing authentication' or 'Create a job for bug fixes'"
        * "Jobs are flexible - the roadmap is optional guidance, not obligation"
      - Ready for ad-hoc development with job-based organization

    create_roadmap_action:
      - Collect user objectives and ideas
      - Organize by priority and visual milestones (dopamine-driven)
      - Negotiate timeline and structure with user
      - Create roadmap.md with structured phases
      - Create jobs in SQLite (all paused except first)
      - Mark setup job as complete, activate first roadmap job
      - Update CLAUDE.md: Replace {{roadmap_summary}} with actual roadmap summary
      - EXPLAIN: "Each roadmap phase becomes a job, but you can create additional jobs anytime"

JOB_MANAGEMENT_FLEXIBILITY:
  - User can create jobs anytime regardless of roadmap
  - When creating new job, Claude asks: "Should I pause the current job and switch to the new one?"
  - Multiple jobs can exist simultaneously (active/paused/completed)
  - Roadmap is a guide, not an obligation - adapt as needed
  - Use @plan.strategy to update/create roadmaps for existing projects

ROADMAP_COMPLETION_HANDLING:
  - When all roadmap jobs complete, options:
    * Create new roadmap with @plan.strategy
    * Create ad-hoc job for next feature/phase
    * Continue organically with user-defined jobs
  - CRITICAL: Never leave system without active job

NEXT_STEPS:
  existing_projects: "System ready - job structure explained - development can begin"
  new_projects: "Ready to begin development following the generated roadmap and job structure"
```

## 🚩 **FLAGS Protocol**

**How FLAGS work for Claude**:

1. **User asks to see flags**: Claude runs `python ~/.claude/scripts/agent_db.py get-workable-flags` and shows pending flags
2. **User types /flags**: Claude invokes `@flags.agent` to orchestrate all pending flags
3. **@flags.agent responds**: Tells Claude EXACTLY how to invoke agents (parallel or sequential)
4. **Claude follows instructions**: Invokes agents as directed, with simple prompt "process your pending flags"

**Example flow**:
```
User: /flags
Claude: "@flags.agent, orchestrate all pending flags"
@flags.agent: "Execute in parallel: [@service.auth, @backend.nodejs]"
Claude: [Invokes both agents in ONE message with Task calls]
```

**IMPORTANT**: Claude never reads flag content or decides execution order - @flags.agent handles all orchestration

## 📊 **NEW VS EXISTING PROJECT COMPARISON**

| Phase | Existing Project             | New Project                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Environment + Database setup | Environment + Database setup            |
| 2     | 4 setup agents analyze code  | 14 interview rounds + specialists       |
| 3     | CLAUDE.md creation           | CLAUDE.md creation                      |
| 4     | Acolyte creation             | Jobs + acolyte creation via plan.strat. |
| 5     | Deep module analysis         | Agent initialization                    |
| 6     | Finalization summary         | Finalization summary                    |

**Key Difference**: Existing projects analyze what exists; new projects plan what will be built.

## ❌ **COMMON ERRORS**

- ❌ Running setup agents sequentially instead of parallel
- ❌ Not creating .claude/project/ documentation
- ❌ Asking user about language preferences (always English)
- ❌ Not creating SQLite database first
- ❌ Creating documentation in wrong location

---

## 🎯 **EXAMPLE EXECUTION**

```bash
User: /setup

Claude:
1. [Phase 1] Environment + Database setup ✅
2. [Phase 2] 
   - IF existing project: "Analyze this project using 4 setup agents IN PARALLEL"
   - IF new project: "Starting requirements interview - Business & Domain questions"
   - Check for missing dependencies and install if needed ⚠️
3. [Phase 3] Generate CLAUDE.md with project context ✅
4. [Phase 4] Create acolytes + jobs (if new project) ✅
5. [Phase 5] Initialize agent memories ✅
6. [Phase 6] "✅ Setup complete: Acolytes for Claude Code ready with full documentation"
```
