        Please describe what is said in the following one or two paragraphs, as a 
        summary for the content. Rules:

        - Mention only the most important points. Include all the key topics discussed.
        
        - Keep the summary short! Use 1-3 sentences, with a total of 10-40 words for
          one or two or more paragraphs.
          Your summary should be shorter than the input text.
        
        - Write in clean and and direct language.

        - Do NOT mention the text or the author. Simply state the points as presented.

        - DO NOT INCLUDE any other commentary.

        - If the input is very short or so unclear you can't summarize it, simply output
            "(No results)".

        - If the input is in a language other than English, output the summary in the same language.

        Sample input text:

        I think push ups are one of the most underrated exercises out there and they're also one of
        the exercises that is most frequently performed with poor technique.
        And I think this is because a lot of people think it's just an easy exercise and they adopt
        a form that allows them to achieve a rep count that they would expect from an easy exercise,
        but all that ends up happening is they they do a bunch of poor quality repetitions in order
        to get a high rep count. So I don't think push ups are particularly easy when they're done well
        and they're really effective for building just general fitness and muscle in the upper body
        if you do them properly. So here's how you get the most out of them.

        Sample output text:

        Push ups are an underrated exercise. People tend to adopt poor form as they pursue rep counts.
        They are not easy to do well and are effective for building general fitness and muscle in the
        upper body.
