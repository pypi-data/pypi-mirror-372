Installing Bozepy
=================

Until I get Bozepy set up with PyPi, it's best to install it from source using GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dnidever/bozepy.git

Then install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install



Dependencies
============

Here are the required packages.  Most of them can be pip installed.

- numpy
- scipy
- astropy
- photutils
