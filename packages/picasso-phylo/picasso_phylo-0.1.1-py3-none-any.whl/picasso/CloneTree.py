CloneTree: Phylogenetic tree analysis and visualization for PICASSO results.

This module provides the CloneTree class for integrating phylogenetic trees with 
clone assignments and CNA data. It enables comprehensive analysis and visualization
of phylogenetic reconstruction results, with specific support for noisy scRNA-seq-
inferred CNA data patterns.

Classes
-------
CloneTree
    Integrates phylogenetic trees, clone assignments, and CNA profiles for
    comprehensive analysis and visualization of tumor evolution patterns.

Examples
--------
Basic usage with PICASSO results:

>>> from picasso import Picasso, CloneTree, load_data
>>> 
>>> # Load example data and run PICASSO phylogenetic inference
>>> cna_data = load_data()
>>> picasso = Picasso(cna_data)
>>> picasso.fit()
>>> 
>>> # Create CloneTree for analysis and visualization
>>> phylogeny = picasso.get_phylogeny()
>>> assignments = picasso.get_clone_assignments()
>>> clone_tree = CloneTree(phylogeny, assignments, cna_data)
>>> 
>>> # Generate visualizations
>>> clone_tree.plot_alterations(save_as='heatmap.pdf')
>>> clone_tree.plot_clone_sizes(save_as='sizes.pdf')

Notes
-----
The CloneTree class is designed to handle:
- Integration of phylogenetic trees with cellular data
- Aggregation of noisy CNA profiles by clone
- Visualization of clonal evolution patterns
- Export to publication-ready formats

        Initialize a CloneTree for analysis and visualization of phylogenetic reconstruction results.
        
        CloneTree integrates phylogenetic trees from PICASSO with clone assignments and CNA 
        data to provide comprehensive analysis and visualization capabilities. It handles
        the aggregation of noisy scRNA-seq-inferred CNA profiles by clone and supports
        various downstream analyses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        phylogeny : ete3.Tree
            The phylogenetic tree with terminal clones as leaves, typically obtained from
            the PICASSO model via get_phylogeny(). Internal nodes represent ancestral
            clones and splitting events.
        clone_assignments : pd.DataFrame
            DataFrame with cell/sample identifiers as index and a 'clone_id' column
            containing clone assignments. Should correspond to the leaves of the phylogeny.
            Typically obtained from PICASSO via get_clone_assignments().
        character_matrix : pd.DataFrame  
            The CNA character matrix where rows are cells/samples and columns are genomic
            features (genes, chromosome arms, bins). Values represent inferred copy number
            states. Should contain the same samples as in clone_assignments.
        clone_aggregation : {'mode', 'mean'}, default='mode'
            Method for aggregating CNA profiles within each clone:
            - 'mode': Use most frequent copy number state (recommended for noisy data)
            - 'mean': Use average copy number (not yet implemented)
        metadata : pd.DataFrame, optional
            Additional sample metadata for visualization and analysis. Index should match
            character_matrix. Common examples include cell type annotations, sample origin,
            experimental conditions.

        Attributes
        ----------
        clone_profiles : pd.DataFrame
            Aggregated CNA profiles for each clone (rows=clones, columns=genomic features).
        clone_profiles_certainty : pd.DataFrame  
            Confidence/certainty scores for each aggregated profile value.
        
        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If clone_assignments lacks 'clone_id' column, if phylogeny leaves don't match
            clone assignments, if sample indices don't match between DataFrames, or if
            clone_aggregation method is invalid.

        Examples
        --------
        Basic usage with PICASSO results:
        
        >>> from picasso import Picasso, CloneTree, load_data
        >>> 
        >>> # Load example data and run PICASSO
        >>> character_matrix = load_data()
        >>> picasso = Picasso(character_matrix)
        >>> picasso.fit()
        >>> 
        >>> # Create CloneTree for analysis
        >>> phylogeny = picasso.get_phylogeny()
        >>> assignments = picasso.get_clone_assignments()
        >>> clone_tree = CloneTree(phylogeny, assignments, character_matrix)
        >>> 
        >>> # Analyze results
        >>> print(f"Number of clones: {len(clone_tree.clone_profiles)}")
        >>> clone_tree.plot_alterations(save_as='cna_heatmap.pdf')
        >>> clone_tree.plot_clone_sizes(save_as='clone_sizes.pdf')

        With metadata for enhanced visualization:
        
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> # Add cell type metadata (example)
        >>> metadata = pd.DataFrame({'cell_type': ['TypeA'] * 50 + ['TypeB'] * 50}, 
        ...                        index=character_matrix.index)
        >>> clone_tree = CloneTree(phylogeny, assignments, character_matrix, 
        ...                       metadata=metadata)
        >>> clone_tree.plot_alterations(metadata=metadata[['cell_type']])

        Notes
        -----
        **Design Considerations for Noisy Data**:
        - Modal aggregation reduces impact of outlier cells within clones
        - Confidence scores help identify uncertain clone profiles
        - Visualization functions highlight clone-specific patterns
        
        **Clone Profile Aggregation**:
        - Mode aggregation finds most common copy number state per feature per clone
        - Handles missing data and ties in noisy scRNA-seq data
        - Certainty scores indicate reliability of aggregated values
        
        **Visualization Capabilities**:
        - Heatmaps show clone-specific CNA patterns
        - Clone size distributions reveal clonal architecture
        - Integration with iTOL for publication-quality figures

        clone-level CNA signatures for downstream analysis and visualization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregation_method : str
            Method for aggregating CNA values within clones:

        Notes
        -----
        **Modal Aggregation**:
        - Finds the most common copy number state for each feature within each clone
        - Handles ties by selecting the first modal value
        - Provides certainty scores based on frequency of the modal state
        - Robust to outlier cells within clones
        - Facilitates visualization of CNA patterns across clones
        
        **Design for Noisy Data**:
        - Modal aggregation reduces impact of noise and technical artifacts
        - Certainty scores help identify unreliable aggregated values

        Identify the most ancestral clone based on CNA profile complexity.
        
        Determines which clone represents the most ancestral state by counting the
        number of copy number alterations (deviations from neutral state). This
        is useful for rooting phylogenetic trees and understanding evolutionary
        relationships.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            Clone identifier of the most ancestral clone (fewest alterations).

        Notes
        -----
        **Ancestral State Assumptions**:
        - Copy number state 0 is considered the ancestral/neutral state
        - Clones with more alterations are considered more derived
        - Useful for establishing evolutionary directionality
        
        **Algorithm**:
        1. Count non-zero states for each clone in aggregated profiles
        2. Select clone with minimum alteration count
        3. Return clone identifier
        
        **Use Cases**:
        - Rooting phylogenetic trees for visualization
        - Identifying putative normal/founder cell populations
        - Understanding tumor evolution trajectories

        Root the phylogenetic tree using a specified outgroup clone.
        
        Establishes evolutionary directionality by setting a designated clone as
        the outgroup, which becomes the root of the tree. This is essential for
        proper interpretation of evolutionary relationships and visualization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        outgroup : str
            Identifier of the clone to use as outgroup. Must be present in the

        Notes
        -----
        **Effects of Rooting**:
        - Changes tree topology and evolutionary interpretation
        - Affects all subsequent tree-based analyses
        - Resets sample phylogeny (if previously generated)
        - Essential for proper tree visualization
        
        **Outgroup Selection Guidelines**:
        - Use most ancestral clone (fewest alterations) when possible
        - Consider biological knowledge about cell populations
        - Avoid clones with many unique alterations
        
        **Implementation Details**:
        - Uses ete3's set_outgroup() method
        - Invalidates cached sample phylogeny

        **Tree Structure**:
        - Leaves represent terminal clones from PICASSO analysis
        - Internal nodes represent inferred ancestral states
        - Branch structure reflects evolutionary relationships
        - Node names correspond to clone identifiers

        - Adds individual cells as children of clone nodes
        - Preserves evolutionary relationships at clone level
        - Enables cell-level analysis within phylogenetic context
        
        **Metadata Integration**:
        - If metadata provided, adds features to cell nodes
        - Features accessible via leaf.features or leaf.get_feature()
        - Enables metadata-aware tree visualization
        
        **Performance Considerations**:
        - Tree generated on first call, then cached
        - Cache invalidated when tree is re-rooted
        - Large datasets may produce complex trees

        Create clustered heatmap visualization of CNA profiles with clone annotations.
        
        Generates a comprehensive heatmap showing copy number alterations across all
        cells, with cells grouped by clone assignment and colored sidebars indicating
        clone membership and optional metadata categories.

        Parameters
        ----------
        metadata : pd.DataFrame, optional
            Additional metadata for enhanced visualization. Index should match 
            character_matrix. Each column represents a metadata category (e.g., 
            cell_type, treatment, tissue). Will be displayed as colored sidebars.
        cmap : str, default='coolwarm'
            Matplotlib colormap for the main heatmap. Common choices:
            - 'coolwarm': Blue-white-red for CNAs (deletions-neutral-amplifications)
            - 'RdBu_r': Red-blue reversed
            - 'viridis': Perceptually uniform colormap
        show : bool, default=True
            Whether to display the plot interactively.
        save_as : str, optional
            File path to save the plot. Supports common formats (.pdf, .png, .svg).
            Recommended: use .pdf for publication quality.
        center : float, optional
            Value at which to center the colormap. If None, uses default centering.
            For CNA data, typically 0 (neutral copy number) or 2 (diploid).

        Examples
        --------
        Basic heatmap with clone annotations:
        
        >>> from picasso import Picasso, CloneTree, load_data

        Notes
        -----
        **Visualization Features**:
        - Cells automatically grouped by clone assignment
        - Clone-specific color sidebar for easy identification
        - Optional metadata sidebars for additional context
        - Configurable color schemes for different data types
        
        **Layout Organization**:
        - Rows: Individual cells/samples
        - Columns: Genomic features (chromosome arms, genes, etc.)
        - Left sidebars: Clone assignments + optional metadata
        - Main heatmap: Copy number alteration values
        
        **Color Interpretation**:
        - Clone sidebar: Each clone gets a distinct color
        - Metadata sidebars: Categorical values get distinct colors  
        - Main heatmap: Continuous colormap for CNA values
        
        **Best Practices**:
        - Use 'coolwarm' colormap for copy number data
        - Center colormap at neutral copy number (typically 0 or 2)
        - Save as PDF for publication-quality figures
        - Include relevant metadata for biological context

        Notes

        **Plot Features**:
        - Histogram showing distribution of clone sizes
        - X-axis: Clone size (number of cells per clone)  
        - Y-axis: Number of clones with that size
        - Kernel density estimate (KDE) overlay for smooth distribution
        - Automatic binning based on data range
        
        **Interpretation**:
        - Right-skewed distribution: Few large clones dominate
        - Uniform distribution: Balanced clonal architecture
        - Left-skewed distribution: Many small clones, rare large ones
        
        **Technical Considerations**:
        - Clone sizes depend on PICASSO parameters (min_clone_size, etc.)
        - Very small clones may indicate noise or over-splitting
        - Very large clones may indicate under-splitting or homogeneity

        Calculate the statistical mode (most frequent value) of a pandas Series.
        
        Computes the most common value in a series, handling edge cases where no
        mode exists or multiple modes are present. Used for aggregating copy number
        states within clones.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series : pd.Series
            Input data series containing numeric values (typically copy number states).

        Returns
        -------
        int, float, or None
            The most frequent value in the series. Returns None if series is empty
            or all values are NaN. If multiple modes exist, returns the first one.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import pandas as pd

        Notes

        indicate more reliable consensus within the data.

        Parameters
        ----------

        **Interpretation Guide**:
        - 1.0: Perfect consensus, all values identical
        - 0.8-0.9: Strong consensus with few outliers
        - 0.5-0.7: Moderate consensus, some heterogeneity
        - <0.5: Weak consensus, high heterogeneity

        Notes

        **Modal Aggregation Process**:
        1. Group cells by clone assignment
        2. For each clone-feature combination, find most frequent copy number state
        3. Calculate frequency of modal state as confidence measure
        4. Handle ties by selecting first modal value
        
        **Confidence Interpretation**:
        - 1.0: All cells in clone have identical copy number state
        - 0.5-0.9: Majority consensus with some variation
        - <0.5: High heterogeneity, unreliable modal state
        
        **Noise Handling**:
        - Modal aggregation naturally filters outlier cells
        - Confidence scores identify unreliable aggregations  
        - Particularly effective for noisy scRNA-seq-inferred CNAs
        
        **Applications**:
        - Generate clean clone signatures for visualization
