# Aim {#aim}

This document serves to organise our joint-development of a python package for unifying machine-learning models for nowcasting. Please contribute to this document by adding/commenting/editing anywhere you would like.

In more detail, we’re aiming for:

* Open-source development through a new github organisation where all contributors have equal ownership in the development software  
* A single python package which:  
  * has simple and clean API for calling different pre-trained ML based nowcasting algorithms  
  * allows for training of ML based nowcasting algorithms  
  * contains functionality to benchmark models including retrieving testing datasets (we envisage storing these on European Weather Cloud S3)  
  * Is tested through ci/cd using github actions (ideally running on GPUs)  
* A community that meets regularly to discuss the package development and further scientific development of techniques for nowcasting with ML.

This collective would give the chance to spread the benefit of access to GPUs for nowcasting: institutes with access to GPUs can train the models, and institutes with little access to GPUs can help develop, test, and ultimately use the models.

**Contribution guidelines**  
Please add yourself to the list of people above. You are welcome to edit/comment on any part of this document. We aim to keep discussion on open questions in a dedicated section below. To answer specific questions please write inline comments, if you wish to clarify and/or get feedback from others use the comment functionality in the document (and possibly tag people using @, to ensure they see your comment/question).

# Open Questions {#open-questions}

*If you have any discussion points you would like to engage people in the community on please list them here*.

QUESTION \[IRS/PG/PEP\]:

- *Would we benefit from crafting a lightweight framework tailored to nowcasting with AI?*   
  - We mean some kind of software framework that can act as an alternative to a much more complex system like 	, which requires a deeper understanding. Maybe by offering simpler models one can adapt a bit to a specific region and offer some recommended standard verification too (but not necessarily multi-parameter or a full simulation). On its back an open-source community can grow, maintaining and expanding the code. We see benefits of a lightweight system or frontend as good and robust baseline / verification for more sophisticated approaches, first point to start off for beginners including an easy how-to, users needing a quick and easy nowcast but focusing on different applications.

  - Point raised by \[DN\]: AI-based Nowcasting models aren’t necessarily less complex than frameworks like anemoi (in terms of ML architecture).   
  - Focusing on specialised models for nowcasting tasks will bring benefits in the shorter term. In the medium term, it is likely that the AI forecasting frameworks (anemoi, py4cast, ml-lam, …) will be able to cover nowcasting applications (that is, high resolution, frequent updates, and data assimilation), and eventually perform as well as specialised nowcasting models.

## 2024/9/23 \- 1300 CEST  {#2024/9/23---1300-cest}

*Kick-off meeting*  
Attendees:

- LCD, IKR, AA, IRS, PEP, KW, JA, CMK, DN, CK, PG

Agenda:

* Discussion of ML Nowcasting Collective vision  
  * Slides link: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QHXz43xrXzO0I2keNXaZYXLrk8WUURCIbcKg82DajW8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QHXz43xrXzO0I2keNXaZYXLrk8WUURCIbcKg82DajW8/edit?usp=sharing)   
* Working document structure

Notes:

* Thoughts on “aims” in discussion section:  
  * Nowcasting functionality could be present and possible with other software frameworks, can we include/use nowcasting functionality in py4cast?  
  * DN, LDC: Forecasting and nowcasting methods are getting closer in their aims  
    * A lot of functionality in pysteps (validation, data readers, visualisation, …)  
    * Pysteps is working on plugins to include pre-trained nowcating models  
    * Xarray is going to be used in pysteps \- [https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps/pull/413](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps/pull/413)  
    * Whatever we code should probably be compatible with the pysteps interfaces to benefit from the existing codebase for evaluation, datasets, …  
  *  Do we want to provide pretrained models or also retrain existing architectures?   
  * “Nowcasting can have a lot of aims” \- what is our goal in nowcasting?  
    * Resolution, timescale, variables (including data-sources/formats in/out)  
    * Source: satellite and/or radar  
  * FG: fine-tuning could also be an aim, just just training from scratch or using pre-training  
  * Should we specify the framework (for example pytorch-lightning) in the aims?  
    * What about pretrained models? Can we reuse the aims from one pretrained model in another DL architecture?  
* ML nowcasting datasets:  
  * Comprehensive nowcasting dataset being made by Gabriele Franch (FBK)  
  * ![][image1]  
* Overlap on anemoi and this project?  
  * MeteoSwiss is exploring doing nowcasting with anemoi, 

Summary: In the meeting, we discussed the vision for the ML Nowcasting Collective, i.e. the joint-development of a python package for unifying machine-learning models for nowcasting.   
In the meeting it was suggested to leverage pysteps' already well-developed features such as validation, data readers, and visualization, along with its new compatibility with Xarray. We discussed the inclusion of pre-trained models versus retraining existing architectures, and the need to define nowcasting aims around resolution, timescale, and data sources (satellite, radar, …). The question arose whether to specify the framework, such as pytorch-lightning, and the chance of future overlap with ML-based forecasting initiatives like anemoi.

## 2024/10/21 \- 1300 CEST {#2024/10/21---1300-cest}

*Meeting 1*  
Attendees:

- IKR, GH, RT, LB, LW, PEP, GF, DN, SO, BH, ILJ, SM, CK, VP, MJ, LDC, MS  
+ Jeffrey N.A., Sola A. (Met Eireann), Christian L. (ECMWF), Theo T. (Meteo-France), Markus D., Saeid V. (WMO), Alberto C., Alexander K., Carlos A. P. A. (DMI), Shubham M., Oriol H. C. (EUMETSAT), Jos dL. (KNMI), KW

Agenda:

- Defining the aim of this collective together  
- Choosing the models and datasets to include as a starting point

Notes:

- Need to standardise data format in a universal way\!  
- We can probably not force frameworks to fit into one specific chosen framework. Rather make a package that enables different frameworks to be used.

- \[DN, GF\] A foundation model for nowcasting?  
  Needs:  
1. Putting together a large dataset (e.g. radar over Europe) to make it possible for the models to generalize  
   1. Radar over Europe OPERA available on EWC available for use ([https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/](https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/)). European met-services have access via their Comp.Reps and academia can apply for EWC access via [R\&D projects](https://user.eumetsat.int/news-events/news/european-weather-cloud-research-and-development-call) or [Special projects](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/special-projects)  
   2. Eumetsat to convert MSG SEVIRI data to OPERA grid with same format by the end of the year  
   3. Standardising data formats\! Common recipe to preprocess the data into zarr file ready for training. Note1: NCzarr [NetCDF Users Guide: The NetCDF NCZarr Implementation](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html), bridges netcdf conventions with zarr. Note2: Alberto C. suggests that hdf5 is still the fastest way [https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/modulus/datapipes/climate](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/modulus/datapipes/climate) ; Note3: AI community can propose adjustments to CF conventions.

   

- \[LB\] Synergies with [https://github.com/meteofrance/py4cast](https://github.com/meteofrance/py4cast) ? framework to compare any model on any dataset  
  - Plan to be used for nowcasting in the next few months  
  - 6 years of 5min rainfall ready for training 

- \[Saeid Vaghefi (WMO)\] From the WMO side, we can assist with the AI for knowledge part, where we connect to the endpoint of nowcast and better communicate the outcomes with end users. Something similar to what we did here: [https://www.chatwmo.app/](https://www.chatwmo.app/)  
- \[Christian L (ECMWF)\]: Comparison between a lot of design choices for ML forecasting models: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07472](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07472).

- EURO HPC proposal suggested by IKR: could this be of interest, to request shared GPU hours? Deadline e.g. December 1, 2024 [https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-development-access\_en](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-development-access_en) 

- **European Nowcasting and forecasting conference in Oslo** 4-8 November 2024 ([https://enwfc-2024.met.no/](https://enwfc-2024.met.no/) ), anyone going?  
- Soma Oláh (development of solar irradiance nowcasting at HungaroMet)  
- Irene K. (DMI)  
- Virginia Poli (comparison between S-PROG and FBK ML technique)

*We’ve tried to break down the work into a set of components. We would like to discuss who would like to contribute to each and whether people are aligned with what will be worked on in each component.*

**Components of mlcast community work:**

**Data**: zarr format – radar (1km, 5min for training, longer is fine for validation) ; satellite (baseline 3km and 15min but can go down to 500m and 5mins; currently using MSG data \+ LSA-SAF data) temporal evolution through regular gridded remote sensing data only; stored in bucket-store European Weather Cloud sponsored by DWD through E-AI

- LCD has started building an **intake catalog** and converting RadKlim to zarr (hosted on EWC) \- *LCD will talk through what this all means :)*  
  - [mlcast-datainfra.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hIlPOer4T9hlxp0mnQ8WQRggSzVUqMID/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110945450609871838015&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
- RT mentioned that E-AI WG have started discussing how this could work, invites our WG to join this work and help frame the design. Standardising Zarr structure data is also discussed in this WG.  
- Possibility options for more resources on EWC:  
  - Joint E-AI tenancy via Marek Jacob  
  - EUMETNET Nowcasting Module inside of the EUMETNET Weather Forecasting Cooperation (E-WFC) has EWC resources allocated in a EUMETNET tenancy.  
  - Member state’s allocation: in order to get access, EUMETSAT and ECMWF Member States can ask their [Computing Representatives](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/contact-us/computing-representatives) (or [support@europeanweather.cloud](mailto:support@europeanweather.cloud) and then EWC support will discuss with comp.reps.)  
  - Via [ECMWF Special Projects](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/special-projects) and/or [EUMETSAT EWC R\&D projects](https://user.eumetsat.int/news-events/news/european-weather-cloud-research-and-development-call)

  - [https://gitlab.fbk.eu/dsip/dsip\_meteo/radar/ceurad](https://gitlab.fbk.eu/dsip/dsip_meteo/radar/ceurad)  
  - Will open the gitlab this week, anything can be migrated/transferred to mlcast-community github  
- DWD might put radar data in the EWC in the future, TBD.  
- EUMETNET OPERA composites are available in EWC: [EUMETSAT \- Data Access \- European Weather Cloud Knowledge Base \- ECMWF Confluence Wiki](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+-+Data+Access)

**Algorithms**: AI-based precip nowcasting and solar radiation nowcasting (to begin with); as long as the nowcast can be initialized with a handful of radar/satellite images. Propose to use pytorch (and pytorch-lightning) as main building blocks for model architectures and training.

- What algorithms should we start with? What are their requirements?  
- Everyone agrees we will build on pytorch and pytorch-lightning deep learning frameworks

**Training resources**:  EuroHPC proposal?

- Both ITA and EU : [https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/access-leonardo-hpc-resources/](https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/access-leonardo-hpc-resources/)  
- Austrian contingent on Leonardo (open once a year, i think): [AURELEO: Austrian users at LEONARDO supercomputer](https://zid.univie.ac.at/it-news/artikel/news/aureleo-austrian-users-at-leonardo-supercomputer/?no_cache=1&cHash=492fc05a45fdb9aac259d763bfd5018c)  
- Who might be interested in helping out:  
  - IKR, GF, IRS, KW, ELB

**Github community:** Maintaining a useful and active space on github where we can collaborate on tooling for preparing datasets and hosting the sourcecode for the eventual *mlcast* python package.

- All work in open-source in our community so we can use github’s free license  
- Currently, only IKR, IRS and LCD are admins, everyone else will be a “member”. Please let LCD know if you would like to be an admin.

**MLOps**: connecting to the MLOps group (E-AI WG3) for sort of integrating some common baseline recommended practices. → IRS will add some information once slides are collected and talk to Gabriela.

  - Stephan Siemen (ECMWF): AI-factory calls of EU → we can contact Stephan if we want to know more  
- Discussing what algorithms to implement:

| Name of model | Deep learning technique | Computational complexity |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| pySTEPS (STEPS,LINDA,S-PROG,...) | None, make pySTEPS techniques | Low-Medium |
|  | UNet | Very low, e.g. [SmaAt-UNet: Precipitation nowcasting using a small attention-UNet architecture \- ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521000556).  |
| LDCast  / ShadeCast /  | Latent Diffusion | Medium |
| DGMR | Generative (GAN) | Low |
| GPTCast | Transformer | High e.g. [https://github.com/DSIP-FBK/GPTCast](https://github.com/DSIP-FBK/GPTCast)  |
| [FACL](https://github.com/argenycw/FACL/tree/main) | Training loss | Low-Medium |
|  | N/A |  |

* GF: each architecture offers different tradeoffs and so we should aim to cover a spectrum of architectures of different complexity  
* LDC: We should make sure baseline techniques from pySTEPS are available through our package too  
* Grouping in the package: deterministic/generative, group on features that they provide  
* LDC: maybe we should consider multi-modal techniques  
* Using NWP model output as input to model as well as observations from radar/satellite  
  * IRS use INCA forecasts of convective precipitation with radar precipitation  
  * GF: Publication on what contributes more (from NWP, Radar, Satellite) to short time variables: [Thunderstorm Nowcasting With Deep Learning: A Multi‐Hazard Data Fusion Model \- Leinonen \- 2023 \- Geophysical Research Letters \- Wiley Online Library](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101626)

## 2025/2/4 \- 1300 CET {#2025/2/4---1300-cet}

4th Meeting  
Attendees: IKR, LCD, MF, AA, BH, GF, KH, CP, GB, EB, JA, SO

Agenda:

- LCD: Discussion on design of mlcast python package:  
  - Slides [20250204\_mlcast\_design\_discussion.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oWmnyxOfUMWgeQi0XyX4fX9YDMX1vl6h/edit?usp=drive_link&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
  - Github repo: [https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast](https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast)  
  - MR: API looks at lot like “ultralytics” [https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/\#use-ultralytics-with-python](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/#use-ultralytics-with-python)  
    [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)   
  - GF: we should expose preprocessing of dataset to user so that they can optimise their choices to fit their hardware. Some preprocessing will be 1\) general across models (normalisation), 2\) specific some architectures (tiling in space) and 3\) always needed (i/o optimisation for chunking)  
    - For tiling: [https://xbatcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://xbatcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
- LCD: Update on progress along community themes (1. Data preparation, 2\. Applications for GPU time)  
  - No meetings have happened yet, people who have shown interest will get an email with a doodle (or similar)  
- Update on E-AI with other WGs in E-AI programme.  
  - There has a lot of work on data preparation going on in other WGs, particularly WG1 Data Curation.  
  - Zarr is the preferred data format  
- OPERA/SEVIRI dataset has been put into object store on European Weather Cloud (see below)  
  - Github issue to discuss how to access dataset: [https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets/issues/2](https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets/issues/2)  
  - Documentation from EWC: [https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=488063253](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=488063253)   
  - Appears that an account on European Weather Cloud may be needed to get object store credentials  
    - Aitor (GeoSphere) suggests we may be able to get a joint access to EWC as a tenancy for the mlcast community, likely a different set credentials for separate users  
  - GF: appears that SEVIRI is at 15min resolution, couldn’t it be in 5min (Rapid Scan)?  
    - Mats: L1.5 from SEVIRI is 5min resolution, L2 is 15min resolution. Maybe this is derived from L2? Gerrit: EWC documentation says they have L1.5

    Conclusion: In the OPERA SEVIRI datacube, OPERA (radar) is at 15min resolution and SEVIRI (satellite) is at 5min resolution 

    → we continue with the plan of incorporating 5min national radar datasets into our own data collection ( with OPERA-SEVIRI being another dataset to include)

  - Make Jupyter notebook to document the dataset (using GAbriele’s template) and include code on how to access and read data based on Balint’s code snippet [Leif Denby](mailto:leifdenby@gmail.com)

Notes:

* OPERA data   
  → Information from Marek Jacob:   
  The EUMETNET OPERA Programme has created a European radar composite product. This will become publicly available by the end of this year. This will include the archive since 2009(?) and real-time data.  
  There are three main products:  
  1\.	**Maximum reflectivity for severe weather applications at 1 km, 5 min resolution**  
  2\.	Surface rain rate at 2 km, 15 min  
  3\.	Hourly accumulated, rain-gauge controlled precipitation at a 1 or 2(?) km grid  
    
  Each NHMS can contact its OPERA representative for data access before end of 2025\. Data licenses can be provided for research purposes.  
    
  In parallel to making the data available via an open API through OPERA, a person at ECMWF is preparing a AI-ready version of the OPERA data.

  → Message from Roope Tervo in RocketChat main channel:   
  We are happy to announce the availability of the OPERA-SEVIRI ML/AI Fusion dataset available in the EWC. The static training dataset for AI/ML applications **containing OPERA weather radar composites and the SEVIRI instrument rapid scan data interpolated to the same spatial grid as OPERA weather radar data**. The data are available from 2018 to 2023 with 5 and 15 minutes time step for OPERA and SEVIRI data respectively. (Note from IKR: from today’s meeting we realize it’s 5 minutes for SEVIRI and 15 minutes for OPERA)  
    
  The data are available in the EWC object storage (S3) buckets and are accessible from the EWC VMs (both EUMETSAT and ECMWF side) without credentials. Please consult Using EUMETSAT data buckets (fresh data pool) \- European Weather Cloud Knowledge Base \- ECMWF Confluence Wiki for more details.  
     
* Discussion point from Balint:

I'd like to kickstart a discussion about the following paper:  
[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382955937\_An\_Individual\_Motion-Driven\_Artificial\_Intelligence\_Method\_for\_Precipitation\_Forecasting\_Using\_Radar\_Image\_Sequencing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382955937_An_Individual_Motion-Driven_Artificial_Intelligence_Method_for_Precipitation_Forecasting_Using_Radar_Image_Sequencing)  
Based on their figures, they've basically solved our task, and have achieved near-perfect predictions. Having followed the literature for over a year, I'm a bit skeptical of these results. But they were kind enough to reply to my concerns and share their code. I found a few lines that could allow ground truth data to leak into the predictions. Would anyone be interested in looking at and experimenting with their code?

Notes:

- New HPC to come in Austria (sort of MUSICA successor)  probably in Autumn (IRS) NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Can apply to this later if needed.

- ECMWF is supporting the creation of ML-ready datasets. RODEO is a project which aims to create ML-ready datasets based on radar observations, focusing on OPERA (2D composites, 2km, 15min). [Slides on RODEO presented by Ana Prieto here](?tab=t.3de1fk6yjj31)  
  - Variables of focus: max reflectivity, 1hr accumulated precip, rain rate  
  - Focus for anemoi: 1hr accumulated precipitation  
  - Dataflow: OPERA ODDYSEY → GRIB2 → MARS → anemoi-dataset (zarr)  
  - Need to clean OPERA data before ML use\!  
  - SEEPS4ALL project: framework for observational data, local climatologies \+ notebooks for verification of forecasts  
  - Plans to include satellite data in future  
  - The data is suited for training graph-based models (anemoi)  
  - Raw opera data could be accessed on the EWC   
  - API to be built by the end of the year to fetch the raw data


- IRS: Training dataset being prepared for solar irradiation  (LSA SAF DSSF\_TOT) under the Destination Earth project (postprocessed from MSG, from the LSA community. 15 min resolution, 3x3 km resolution). 2014 \- on (10+ years). More information to come in the future.

- LDC: pysteps has new plugins feature [https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer\_guide/importer\_plugins.html](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer_guide/importer_plugins.html) 

    → \[IKR\] we should make our framework compatible with this

- Side note from ARJJ: this course gives a really nice explanation on using ml for disaster management solutions by processing satellite imagery data. [https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course\_id=course-v1:DLI+S-ES-01+V1](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-ES-01+V1)

    * timestep isn’t necessarily uniform to accommodate for metservices changing the radar time step throughout “history”  
    * Fixed spatial coordinate, pad with NaNs where domain was increased in size over time   
    * NaNs used for any points in (x,y,time) where there are no observations  
    * Either expressing precipitation as 1\) reflectivity (dBz), 2\) rain rate (mm per hour), or 3\) accumulated rainfall (mm)  
  * From zarr datasets create cropped “areas of interest” to create training datasets  
  * Further steps:  
    * Make “better” time-chunking, should probably aim for having larger chunks, in general array recommend \~100MB chunks: [https://blog.dask.org/2021/11/02/choosing-dask-chunk-sizes?utm\_source=xarray-docs](https://blog.dask.org/2021/11/02/choosing-dask-chunk-sizes?utm_source=xarray-docs)  
    * Add CF-compliant projection info, units  
    * Copy zarr datasets to buckets on EWC. For datasets that have license that allow for public access the buckets will allow public read, for the other buckets we will need a mechanism for distributing keys within the community  
    * Build publicly accessible intake catalog ([https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets](https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets)) with notebooks that demonstrate how to use datasets  
* Update on software package? LCD  
  * Currently we still have the proposal for software structure ([20250204\_mlcast\_design\_discussion.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oWmnyxOfUMWgeQi0XyX4fX9YDMX1vl6h/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1)) in-person E-AI meeting will be an opportunity to discuss structure more and decide how to refactor implementations of the architectures into a single package.  
* HEU (Horizon Europe) proposal to get funding to work together on MLCast?  
  * LesleyDC will start discussion? :) IKR is interested in contributing\! Anyone have experience with Horizon proposals?   
    * Yes, LCD contributed to Horizon proposal (not funded though), but I can help with internal (DMI) process 🙂  
* LDC: already scanned the drafts of the HEU25 for potential calls:  
  * Pre-publication Horizon Europe Work Programme 2025: [https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/horizon-europe-work-programmes\_en\#pre-publication-of-work-programme-2025](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/horizon-europe-work-programmes_en#pre-publication-of-work-programme-2025)

    * Link to application page: [https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hpc-access/access-cineca-resources/iscra-projects/iscra-project-size/](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hpc-access/access-cineca-resources/iscra-projects/iscra-project-size/)    
    * PDF of the submitted application: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzXWEu8HPeLv7zpbMKNaCQex6Q65qFJo/view?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzXWEu8HPeLv7zpbMKNaCQex6Q65qFJo/view?usp=drive_link)  
    * GF is PI and can grant access to resources  
    * Plan to start making use of resources at in-person meeting organised within E-AI Offenbach in July  
    * Will enable application for larger pool of GPU resources, aiming for order 100K GPU hours for next application.  
  * Reminder of in-person meeting on July 9th 2025 ([https://www.eumetnet-ai.eu/2025/workshop3/](https://www.eumetnet-ai.eu/2025/workshop3/) )  
  * Aim for source datasets (precipitation at 5min, 1km resolution) in catalog, data from the following institutions:  
    * DWD. Opendata (known as RadKlim)  
    * RMI. License?  
    * KNMI: Opendata [https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/nl-rdr-data-rtcor-5m-tar-1-0](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/dataset/nl-rdr-data-rtcor-5m-tar-1-0)   
    * IT. License? (opendata since 2020, TBD before)  
    * MetOffice:  Apparently now it’s opendata\! [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)  [https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/27dd6ffba67f667a18c62de5c3456350](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/27dd6ffba67f667a18c62de5c3456350)   
  * Status on Opera-SEVIRI dataset:  
    * Time resolution is 15min, so little lower that we are aiming for first release (5min time resolution)  
  * MLCast roadmap defined  
    * First release v0.1.0, \~3 models trained for radar-based precipitation nowcasting, 5min timestep, 1km resolution  
      * Proposed first algorithms: LDCast, GPTCast, ConvLSTM. All trained on the same dataset. Start with ConvLSTM at E-AI workshop  
  * Need software package “best practices” guru.  
    * How to make a good software package?

* Presentation from LCD (20mins): Intake catalog launch  
  * We have precipitation datasets in different formats → convert them to zarr following CF conventions → store them on an object store (e.g. European Weather Cloud) → Make an intake catalog to retrieve any part of the dataset from e.g. a jupyter notebook.  
  * Here is the repository for MLCast Community intake catalog [https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets](https://github.com/mlcast-community/mlcast-datasets)  
  * Leif turned the needed packages for handling the datasets, into a python package (mlcast-datasets)  
    \*pip install mlcast-datasets\* \!\!  
  * → Step 1 for this community: have all datasets versioned. How to formalize this? If a dataset is changed (larger domain, new units, etc.), it should be documented. Ensure versioning of the catalog as well\! (new datasets, etc)  
  * Question: how to organize uploading to EWC? Currently we are using the DWD allocation, but we need an allocation for the community.  
  * The intake catalog is currently for “source” datasets. I.e. not optimized for training. Could have a second catalog for “training” datasets that are optimized for the different architectures (patches, etc. )  
* Discussion on Horizon proposals (LDC?)  
  * → check meeting notes from previous meeting to see the different calls suggested by LDC.

  * One suitable option could be: HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-DRS-02:   
    **Open topic on Improving disaster risk management and governance to ensure self-sufficiency and sustainability of operations in support of enhanced resilience**  
    Option a: Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness  
      
  * For that call we need connection to: *at least 2 Regional and/or Local Authorities, 1 disaster management authority, and 1 Volunteers Organisation from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries*  
  * Any civil protection partners? GF (regional civ.prot.), KW (safety regions, government authorities for water management. We have contacts with Red Cross who could be volunteer organisation)

  * **Who wants to join the proposal?** IKR, GF, AM, LCD, MSC, KW, IrS, SAV, AA

  E.g. Ricardo Jara retraining LDCast on Danish radar data, Iris Odak retraining SHADECast on SARAH3 solar radiation data.


  \+ tutorial on getting started with Leonardo with convLSTM on example from DWD radar data set


+ Discussion on roadmap for the package

  Who will be there? Irene K, Kirien, Irene S, Sina M., Ricardo, Oriol , Soma, Balint H., Gabriele F., Marek


* Little demo on using the notebooks and the intake catalog and plan on how to proceed with data (IKR)   
  * Uploading other data to the EWC: Irene K is contact point while Leif is on leave and will connect with Marek on how to upload the data

* Update on Horizon proposal idea (IKR) \- Lesley will contact the people who wrote their initials in the previous meeting notes, to organize a first drafting session.

* Anything else?   
  * Contact in general: maybe we can have a single-entry point mailing list or something similar (e.g. ml-cast@...) → discuss in Offenbach during in-person meeting  
  * Streaming of Offenbach meeting(?): screen sharing and streaming presentation will be possible (one-way)

Notes:

- Next meeting just before in-person meeting @Offenbach → usual online meeting will be canceled and Offenbach in-person meeting will be streamed  
- Structure of session in Offenbach discussion, ideally all three parts have equal amount of time (we have before and after the coffee break), \~2 hours \+ 30 min break.   
  - Overview methods: appr. 30 mins planned (a bit shorter would be possible if we want to save more time for the other parts)   
  - Implementation of AI into operational services (\~15mins)  
  - Demo session Leonardo   
- Workshop registration: [https://www.eumetnet-ai.eu/2025/workshop3/](https://www.eumetnet-ai.eu/2025/workshop3/) Registration Deadline: **Monday 9 June, 2025**
