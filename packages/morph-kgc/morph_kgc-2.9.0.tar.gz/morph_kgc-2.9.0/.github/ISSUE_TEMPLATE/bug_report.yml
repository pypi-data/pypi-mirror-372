      description: |
        Please provide steps to reproduce the behavior, preferably a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example). Please adhere to the following guidelines:

        * Format the code, mappings, data and output as [code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) using triple backticks:

          ````
          ```ttl
          MAPPINGS HERE
          ```
          ````
        * Make sure that the script, mappings, data and output are provided in separate code blocks.
        * Specify a [language identifier](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting) in the code block for syntax highlighting (`ttl` for RML and RDF; `yml` for YARRRML; `python` for code; `csv`, `json`, `xml` for data...) 
        * If applicable, provide the script with the Python user-defined functions.
        * Confirm if the issue is reproducible via command line or executing as a library.
