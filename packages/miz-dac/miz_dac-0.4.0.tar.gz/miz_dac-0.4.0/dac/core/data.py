from dac.core import DataNode, ContextKeyNode

r"""Concepts and principles

- Workable without container
- Data types are directly use-able as action required
- Member types are direct objects (not the identifier to get target object from container)
- "Definition"s contain just basic elements (int/float/str/dict/list/bool/...)
- Provide hint (<type hint> or [literal hint]) for members
