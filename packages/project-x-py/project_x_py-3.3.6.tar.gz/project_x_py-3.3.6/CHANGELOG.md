suite_stats = await suite.get_stats()        # Async

# New (v3.3.0) - All async
stats = await suite.orders.get_stats()       # Now async
suite_stats = await suite.get_stats()        # Still async
```

**2. Replace Old Statistics Mixins**
```python
# Old (v3.2.x)
from project_x_py.utils import EnhancedStatsTrackingMixin

class MyComponent(EnhancedStatsTrackingMixin):
    pass

# New (v3.3.0)

### Added
- **⏱️ Bar Timer Mechanism**: Automatic bar creation during low-volume periods
  - Creates empty bars (volume=0) at regular intervals when no ticks arrive

## Release Notes

### Upgrading to v0.2.0

If you're upgrading from v0.1.0, please note the following breaking changes:

1. **Import Changes**:
   ```python
   # Old (v0.1.0)
   from project_x_py import ProjectX

   # New (v0.2.0) - same import, but underlying structure changed
   from project_x_py import ProjectX  # Still works
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Required (same as before)
   export PROJECT_X_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export PROJECT_X_USERNAME="your_username"

   # New optional configuration variables
   export PROJECTX_API_URL="https://api.topstepx.com/api"
   export PROJECTX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="30"
   export PROJECTX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS="3"
   ```

3. **Client Initialization**:
   ```python
   # Recommended new approach
   client = ProjectX.from_env()  # Uses environment variables

   # Or with explicit credentials (same as before)
   client = ProjectX(username="user", api_key="key")

   # Or with custom configuration
   config = ProjectXConfig(timeout_seconds=60)
   client = ProjectX.from_env(config=config)
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   ```python
   # New specific exception types
   try:
       client = ProjectX.from_env()
       account = client.get_account_info()
   except ProjectXAuthenticationError:
       print("Authentication failed")
   except ProjectXServerError:
       print("Server error")
   except ProjectXError:
       print("General ProjectX error")
   ```

### Migration Guide

1. **Update imports**: No changes needed - existing imports still work
2. **Update error handling**: Consider using specific exception types
3. **Use new factory methods**: `ProjectX.from_env()` is now recommended
4. **Optional**: Set up configuration file for advanced settings
5. **Optional**: Use new utility functions for logging and formatting

### New Installation Options

```bash
# Basic installation (same as before)
pip install project-x-py

# With real-time features
pip install project-x-py[realtime]

# With development tools
pip install project-x-py[dev]

# Everything
pip install project-x-py[all]
```
