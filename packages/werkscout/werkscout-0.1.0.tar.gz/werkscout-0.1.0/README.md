# WerkScout

**WerkScout** is a Python library designed to help you slice large search requests into manageable, polite chunks and extract relevant data (e.g., emails) from web pages.

##  Features
- **Simple search query slicing**: allows segmentation by domain, keyword patterns, and more.
- **Email scraping with Selenium**: robust routines using `ScrapeScript.py`.
- **Domain lookup helpers**: utility functions in `searchEngines.py`.
- **SQLite support**: integrated `DbContext.py` for storing and retrieving data.
- **API abstraction**: central API handling in `Api.py`.
- **Respectful web scraping**: rate limiting and retry logic built in—designed to avoid getting blocked.
