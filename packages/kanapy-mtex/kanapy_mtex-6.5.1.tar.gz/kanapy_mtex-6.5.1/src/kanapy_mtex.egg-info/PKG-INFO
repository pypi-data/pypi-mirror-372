# Kanapy-mtex

### Python tool for microstructure analysis and generation of 3D microstructure models with backend based on [MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/) library and [MatlabEngine](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/apiref/matlab.engine.matlabengine-class.html).

Kanapy and Kanapy-mtex are [python](http://www.python.org) packages for generating complex three-dimensional (3D) synthetic
polycrystalline microstructures. The microstructures are built based on statistical information about phase and grain morphologies, given as size distributions and aspect ratio distrubitions of grains and phase regions. Furthermore, crystallographic texture is considered in form of orientation distribution functions (ODF) and misorientation distribution functions (MDF). Kanapy and Kanapy-mtex offers tools to analyze EBSD maps with respect to the morphology and texture of microstructures. Based on this experimental data, 3D synthetic microstructures are generated mimicking real ones in a statistical sense.  

Kanapy-mtex is based on the core functions of the standard pure-python version of [Kanapy](https://icams.github.io/Kanapy/builds/html/index.html). However, in this version the texture module of Kanapy is implemented in form of
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) functions using several algorithms implemented in
[MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/) for texture analysis.

## Features

-   Kanapy and Kanapy-mtex offer a Python Application Programming Interface (API).
-   Kanapy-mtex has the possibility to analyze experimental microstructures based on [MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/) functions.
-   Support of multiphase microstructures.
-   Generation of 3D microstructure morphology based on statistical features as size distributions and aspect ratio distributions of grains and phase regions.
-   Crystallographic texture reconstruction using orientations from
    experimental data in form of Orientation Distribution Function (ODF).
-   Optimal orientation assignment based on measured Misorientation Distribution Function (MDF) that maintains correct statistical description of high-angle or low-angle grain boundary characteristics.
-   Independent execution of individual modules through easy data
    storage and handling.
-   In-built hexahedral mesh generator for representation of complex polycrystalline microstructures in form of voxels.
-   Efficient generation of space filling structures by particle dynamics method.
-   Collision handling of particles through a two-layer
    collision detection method employing the Octree spatial data
    structure and the bounding sphere hierarchy.
-   Option to generate spherical particle position and radius files
    that can be read by the Voronoi tessellation software
    [Neper](http://neper.sourceforge.net/).
-   Option to generate input files for finite-element packages.
-   Import and export of voxel structures according to following the modular materials data schema published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ronakshoghi/MetadataSchema.git) for data transfer between different tools.

## Installation

The preferred method to use Kanapy-mtex is within [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), but it can by used within any 
Python environment supporting the package installer for python [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). 


The latest stable version of Kanapy-mtex can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kanapy-mtex/) via pip by executing the command

```
$ pip install kanapy-mtex
```

Alternatively, the most recent version of the complete repository, including the source code, documentation and examples, can be cloned and installed locally. It is recommended to create a conda environment before installation. This can be done by the following the command line instructions

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ICAMS/kanapy-mtex.git ./kanapy-mtex
$ cd kanapy-mtex
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate knpy_mtex
(knpy) $ python -m pip install .
```

The core functions of Kanapy-mtex are now installed along with all dependencies. 

### Kanapy-mtex texture module

If you intend
to use the Kanapy-mtex texture module with the [MTEX](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/) backend, a
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) installation is required and the [MatlabEngine](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/apiref/matlab.engine.matlabengine-class.html) needs to be started. This can be done with the shell command

``` 
(knpy) $ kanapy setupMTEX
```
**Note:** The absolute paths to {user\_dependent\_path}/site-packages/kanapy_mtex and {user\_dependent\_path}/site-packages/kanapy_mtex/libs/mtex should to be added to the MATLABPATH environment variable, see [Mathworks&reg; documentation](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-folders-to-matlab-search-path-at-startup.html#). If the texture module is installed as described above, this is done automatically within Kanapy-mtex.


**Note:** The installation scripts have been tested for Matlab R2024a and R2025a with Python 3.9 and 3.10 on current Linux, MacOS and Windows systems. If you are using other Matlab versions, the script "setupMTEX" might fail. In that case, you or a system administrator can setup the Matlab Engine API for Python manually. To do so, please follow the instructions given on [Mathworks&reg;](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html). The Python version of the *knpy*-environment can be changed according to the requirements of the Matlab Engine API by editing the `environment.yml` file and re-creating the conda environment *knpy*.

**Note:** Kanapy-mtex uses a local version of MTEX stored in `src/kanapy_mtex/libs/mtex`, if you want to use another MTEX version, please set the paths accordingly. 

For full installations of Kanapy-mtex from the [GitHub](https://github.com/ICAMS/kanapy-mtex.git) repository, the correct installation of the MTEX backend can be tested with

```
(knpy) $ kanapy runTests
```


### Using Kanapy-mtex in your Python scripts
After installation by any of those methods, the package can be used as API within python, e.g. by importing the entire package with

```python
import kanapy_mtex as knpy_mtex
```

### Command line tools
Kanapy supports some command line tools, a list of supported tools can be displayed with

```
(knpy) $ kanapy --help          
```

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The alpha-version of the GUI can be started with the shell command

```
(knpy) $ kanapy gui
```


## Examples
Kanapy comes with several examples in form of Python scripts and Juypter notebooks. If you want to create a local copy of the kanapy/examples directory within the current working directory (cwd), please run the command

```
(knpy) $ kanapy copyExamples          
```

The run these examples with the MTEX backend, make sure to import kanapy_mtex instead of kanapy.

## Documentation

The Kanapy documentation is available online on GitHub Pages: [https://icams.github.io/Kanapy/](https://icams.github.io/Kanapy/) and can directly be displayed with

```
(knpy) $ kanapy readDocs           
```

The documentation for Kanapy is generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
