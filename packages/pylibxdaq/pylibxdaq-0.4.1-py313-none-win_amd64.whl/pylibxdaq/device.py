"""
pylibxdaq: Python binding layer for XDAQ device management

This module provides a high-level interface to enumerate and access
XDAQ devices using dynamically loaded device managers.

Note:
    Devices must be used as context managers to ensure proper resource release.
    Re-opening a device without cleanup may lead to hardware conflicts.
