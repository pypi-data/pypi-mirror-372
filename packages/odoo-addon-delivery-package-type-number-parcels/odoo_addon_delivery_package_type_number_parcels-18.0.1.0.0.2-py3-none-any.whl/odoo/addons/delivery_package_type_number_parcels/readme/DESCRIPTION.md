This module allows to pre-configure a number of parcels on the delivery package type.
When creating a delivery package and associating a package type, the number of parcels of the package will be initialized from the delivery package type.
You can create one package type per possible number of parcels, like "1 parcel", "2 parcels", "3 parcels"...
When packing, select or scan the package type barcode to make a package for all picked lines with the right declared amount of parcels.
This prevents you to declare which picked line and corresponding quantity is in which parcel.

The number of parcels is also displayed in the delivery package
wizard when selecting a package type, giving users immediate
visibility of the parcel count during the delivery process.
