"""
    This function differs from previous functions in that it enables multipage navigation, allowing you to freely return to the previous page, navigate to the next page, and return to the homepage. However, it does not have image functionality and is only suitable for quick apps without image features.
    If you need image functionality, please import the img_pages() function from easyapp_don.supermarket.imgbooks.Imgbook.
    It is actually a simplified version of the img_pages() function without image support, making it convenient for users who don't have image materials to run.
    The advantage is that you don't even need to write much code - just write a pages() function to create a simple 3-page scenario.
    Note that when writing the function, do not mistakenly write it as page() - that would be incorrect! page() is a function for creating a single page, which can create a multi-functional single page, not multiple pages like pages().
    The pages() function is the foundation of img_pages(). Let's talk about the parameters of Pagebook's pages().
    Special note: Sizes and positions are between 0 and 1, referring to the proportion of the parent container.
    :param page: This is a dictionary with numerous custom parameters. When writing this parameter, it's best to follow the format in easyapp_don.supermarket.pagebooks.__main__, where each page can automatically populate parameters. Many local parameters like tip also have custom sub-parameters such as txt, yie, ok, cal. You don't need to write all of them - just modify the parameters you want to change, achieving parameter freedom. We also emphasize fault tolerance. For example, in the text 2D list ts, the default position is the center (i.e., (0.5, 0.5)). If you don't want to change the position, just write the content, and we will automatically complete it for you.
    Take a look at the parameter format (not required; you only need to modify key parameters when filling in):

    ["Hello, easyapp_don!", (0.5, 0.9)], # This is page content. The first part is text content, the second is position. If you don't want to write the position, you can omit it, and it will default to the center.
