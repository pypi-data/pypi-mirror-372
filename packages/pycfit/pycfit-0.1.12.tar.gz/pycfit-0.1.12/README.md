# Python Component Fitting Tool  (pycfit)

Python program to replicate many spectral fitting functions of the CFIT system from SolarSoft IDL.  



# Installation

`pip install pycfit`

### ðŸ›  Important: Conda Environments Must Have Python Installed
If using Conda, ensure your environment includes Python before installing:

```sh
conda create --name myenv python
conda activate myenv

pip install pycfit
```
 

# Use
### Use interactive fitter to find an initial model based on an averaged spectra

```python
import pycfit

# Retrieve sample data
wavelength, intensity, uncertainty = pycfit.data.get_example_single_spectra()

# Call the GUI fitter
model = pycfit.cfit_gui(wavelength, intensity, uncertainty=uncertainty)
```


### Use the interactive viewer to fit each point of the raster to the initial model and adjust or mask individual point fittings as needed
```python
# Retrieve a small-patch of sample data
wavelength, intensity, uncertainty, mask = pycfit.data.get_example_grid_spectra(patch=True)

# Create a Grid fitter, using the previously defined model
myGrid = pycfit.cfit_grid(model, wavelength, intensity, 
                uncertainty=uncertainty, mask=mask)

# Fit the whole raster
myGrid.fit(maxiter=100) # Astropy fitter keywords like "maxiter" can be passed through

# Inspect and modify the fits at each point
print(myGrid.shape)
myGrid = pycfit.cfit_grid_gui(myGrid)

# Get results
results = myGrid.get_results()
```
