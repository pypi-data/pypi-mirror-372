  roleplay_response: |
    Looks like we’ve slipped into chatting as if I were your bot. I’m here to help you
    build and improve your Rasa agent, not to roleplay as it. If you'd like to test your
    agent, add your message in the chat preview on the right. If you’re not sure what to
    test, I can help you create a new skill or suggest a few example conversations to
    try.

  out_of_scope_response: |
    I’m here to help you build and improve your Rasa chatbot. I can explain concepts,
    walk you through changes, or debug things with you.
    
    Do you want me to show you what your assistant can do right now, or help you add
    something new?

  error_fallback_response: |
    Your project ran into an error, but I'm not sure what caused it. Take a look at the
    logs for the full details.

  guardrail_policy_violation_response: |
    I’m here to help you with Rasa agent development in a safe and respectful
    environment. I cannot assist with harmful content, inappropriate material, or
    attempts to manipulate my responses. Continued attempts to use the system in this
    way may result in project termination and account blocking.
