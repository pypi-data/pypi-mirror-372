______________________________________________________________________

# Quick Start

Install LitAI via pip ([more options](https://lightning.ai/docs/litai/home/install)):

```bash
pip install litai
```
Get your API key [here](https://lightning.ai/sign-up?okbhrt=x334uv8t7v) and chat with any AI model:

```python
from litai import LLM

# 20+ models... "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "lightning-ai/gpt-oss-120b"
llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5", api_key="<LIT_API_KEY>")
answer = llm.chat("who are you?")
print(answer)

# I'm an AI by OpenAI
```

Or use your own [OpenAI compatible client](#openai-compatible)

<br/>

# Why LitAI?
Juggling model APIs is a mess - flaky endpoints, retries, fallbacks, billing, logging, picking the right model every time. Agent frameworks promise to help, but they’re hard to learn, full of magic, hard to control, and break down fast in real-world systems. Even simple things like tool calls or prompt formatting get rewritten behind the scenes. Teams end up rebuilding it all in raw Python just to get something they can trust.

WIth LitAI there's nothing to learn - if you know Python you already know LitAI. You get both an LLM router and a minimal agent framework in one. Just write normal Python, call any model, and sprinkle in `.chat()`, `.if_()`, or `.classify()` wherever the model should step in. It gives you lightweight, minimal building blocks you’d end up building yourself: model calls, retries, fallbacks, tool use, memory, streaming - all in clean, testable code. No wrappers, no magic - just code that works the way you expect.

[LitAI vs other agent frameworks](https://lightning.ai/docs/litai/home/why-litai#comparisons)   

<br/>

# Examples
If you know Python, you already know LitAI 🤯 - just sprinkle a few "smart" agent decisions.

### Agent
Here's a simple agent that tells you the latest news

```python
import re, requests
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5-mini", api_key="<LIGHTNING_API_KEY>")

website_url = "https://text.npr.org/"
website_text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', ' ', requests.get(website_url).text)

response = llm.chat(f"Based on this, what is the latest: {website_text}")
print(response)
```

### Agentic if statement
We believe the best way to build agents is with normal Python programs and simple **“agentic if statements.”** 
This keeps 90% of the logic deterministic, and the model only steps in when needed. No complex abstractions, no framework magic - just code you can trust and debug.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM()

product_review = "This TV is terrible."
response = llm.chat(f"Is this review good or bad? Reply only with 'good' or 'bad': {product_review}").strip().lower()

if response == "good":
    print("good review")
else:
    print("bad review")
```

### Shortcuts
Agentic workflows mostly come down to agentic-if statements or classification decisions. While you can use `llm.chat` yourself to do it,
we provide 2 simple shortcuts

```python
from litai import LLM
llm = LLM()

# shortcut for agentic if statement (can do this yourself with llm.chat if needed)
product_review = "This TV is terrible."
if llm.if_(product_review, "is this a positive review?"):
    print("good review")
else:
    print("bad review")

# shortcut for agentic classification (can do this yourself with llm.chat if needed)
sentiment = llm.classify("This movie was awful.", ["positive", "negative"])
print("Sentiment:", sentiment)
```

### Tools ([docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/litai/features/tools))
Tools allow models to get real-world data or take actions. In LitAI, there is no magic with tool use, agents can decide to call tools (`auto_call_tools=True`), or you can manually call a tool with `llm.call_tool(...)` for full control. Zero magic, just plain Python.

```python
from litai import LLM, tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny"

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

# OPTION A: automatic tool call
result = llm.chat("What's the weather in Tokyo?", tools=[get_weather], auto_call_tools=True)
# The weather in Tokyo is sunny

# OPTION B: manually call tools for more control
chosen_tool = llm.chat("What's the weather in Tokyo?", tools=[get_weather])
result = llm.call_tool(chosen_tool, tools=[get_weather])
# The weather in London is sunny
```

Choose automatic or manual tool calling based on production needs. `auto_call_tools=True` is great for quick demos, but can obscure when and why a tool runs which can lead to surprises in production. `llm.call_tool(...)` gives you full control to decide when tools execute, making it easier to log, debug, test, and audit. This clarity is critical for reliability, safety, and trust in real-world systems.

# Advanced features

### Auto fallbacks and retries ([docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/litai/features/fallback-retry))

Model APIs can flake or can have outages. LitAI automatically retries in case of failures. After multiple failures it can automatically fallback to other models in case the provider is down.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(
    model="openai/gpt-5",
    fallback_models=["google/gemini-2.5-flash", "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"],
    max_retries=4,
)

print(llm.chat("What is a fun fact about space?"))
```

<br/>

### OpenAI compatible
For those who already have their own SDK to call LLMs (like the OpenAI sdk), you can still use LitAI via the `https://lightning.ai/api/v1` endpoint,
which will track usage, billing, etc...

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://lightning.ai/api/v1",
  api_key="LIGHTNING_API_KEY",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-5-mini",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is a fun fact about space?"
    }
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

<details>
<summary>Granular billing</summary>

<br/>

Organize billing for API calls at organization, teamspace and user level.

# Example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://lightning.ai/api/v1",
  api_key="LIGHTNING_API_KEY/organization/teamspace",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-5-mini",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is a fun fact about space?"
    }
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Tools</summary>

<br/>
  
Models can only reply with text, but tool calling lets them get real-world data or act, like checking calendars or sending messages, which allows AI apps to actually do things, not just talk. There are 2 ways to create tools in LitAI.

`@tool`: Turn any function into a tool with `litai.tool` decorator - useful when you just need a quick, simple tool.   

```python
from litai import LLM, tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny"

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

chosen_tool = llm.chat("What's the weather in Tokyo?", tools=[get_weather])

result = llm.call_tool(chosen_tool, tools=[get_weather])
# The weather in London is sunny
```
  
`LitTool`: For more production-ready tools that encapsulate more logic, maintain state and can be shared across programs, use `LitTool`: 

```python
from litai import LLM, LitTool

class FAQTool(LitTool):
    def setup(self):
        self.faq = {
            "pricing": "You can view our pricing plans on the website.",
            "support": "Our support team is available 24/7 via chat.",
            "refund": "Refunds are available within 30 days of purchase."
        }

    def run(self, question: str) -> str:
        keyword = question.lower()
        for topic, answer in self.faq.items():
            if topic in keyword:
                return answer
        return "Sorry, I couldn't find an answer for that."

tool = FAQTool()

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")
response = llm.chat("How do I get a refund?", tools=[tool])
result = llm.call_tool(response, tools=[tool])

print(result)  # → "Refunds are available within 30 days of purchase."
```

##### Note: LitAI also supports any tool that is a pydantic BaseModel.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Streaming</summary>

<br/>

Real-time chat applications benefit from showing words as they generate which gives the illusion of faster speed to the user.  Streaming
is the mechanism that allows you to do this.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")
for chunk in llm.chat("hello", stream=True):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
````
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Concurrency with async</summary>

<br/>

Advanced Python programs that process multiple requests at once rely on "async" to do this. LitAI can work with async libraries without blocking calls. This is especially useful in high-throughput applications like chatbots, APIs, or agent loops.   

To enable async behavior, set `enable_async=True` when initializing the `LLM` class. Then use `await llm.chat(...)` inside an `async` function.

```python
import asyncio
from litai import LLM

async def main():
    llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5", teamspace="lightning-ai/litai", enable_async=True)
    print(await llm.chat("who are you?"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Multi-turn conversations</summary>

<br/>

Models only know the message that was sent to them. To enable them to respond with memory of all the messages sent to it so far, track the related
message under the same conversation.  This is useful for assistants, summarizers, or research tools that need multi-turn chat history.

Each conversation is identified by a unique name. LitAI stores conversation history separately for each name.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

# Continue a conversation across multiple turns
llm.chat("What is Lightning AI?", conversation="intro")
llm.chat("What can it do?", conversation="intro")

print(llm.get_history("intro"))  # View all messages from the 'intro' thread
llm.reset_conversation("intro")  # Clear conversation history
```

Create multiple named conversations for different tasks.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

llm.chat("Summarize this text", conversation="summarizer")
llm.chat("What's a RAG pipeline?", conversation="research")

print(llm.list_conversations())
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Switch models on each call</summary>

<br/>

In certain applications you may want to call ChatGPT in one message and Anthropic in another so you can use the best model for each task. 
LitAI lets you dynamically switch models at request time.

Set a default model when initializing `LLM` and override it with the `model` parameter only when needed.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

# Uses the default model (openai/gpt-5)
print(llm.chat("Who created you?"))
# >> I am a large language model, trained by OpenAI.

# Override the default model for this request
print(llm.chat("Who created you?", model="google/gemini-2.5-flash"))
# >> I am a large language model, trained by Google.

# Uses the default model again
print(llm.chat("Who created you?"))
# >> I am a large language model, trained by OpenAI.
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Multiple models, same conversation</summary>

<br/>

One application of LitAI is to reduce costs of chats by using separate models for the same conversation. For example, use a cheap model to answer
the first question and a more expensive model for something that requires more intelligence.

```python
from litai import LLM

llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-5")

# use a cheap model for this question
llm.chat("Is this a number or word: '5'", model="google/gemini-2.5-flash", conversation="story")

# go back to the expensive model
llm.chat("Create a story about that number like Lord of the Rings", conversation="story")

print(llm.get_history("story"))  # View all messages from the 'story' thread
```

</details>
