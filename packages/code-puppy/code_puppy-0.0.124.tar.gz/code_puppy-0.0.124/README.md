*"Who needs an IDE?"* - someone, probably.

## Overview

*This project was coded angrily in reaction to Windsurf and Cursor removing access to models and raising prices.* 

*You could also run 50 code puppies at once if you were insane enough.*

*Would you rather plow a field with one ox or 1024 puppies?* 
    - If you pick the ox, better slam that back button in your browser.
    

Code Puppy is an AI-powered code generation agent, designed to understand programming tasks, generate high-quality code, and explain its reasoning similar to tools like Windsurf and Cursor. 

## Quick start

`uvx code-puppy -i`


## Features

- **Multi-language support**: Capable of generating code in various programming languages.
- **Interactive CLI**: A command-line interface for interactive use.
- **Detailed explanations**: Provides insights into generated code to understand its logic and structure.

## Command Line Animation

## Installation

`pip install code-puppy`

## Usage
```bash
export MODEL_NAME=gpt-5 # or gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 as an example for Google Gemini models
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key> # or GEMINI_API_KEY for Google Gemini models
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=<your_cerebras_api_key> # for Cerebras models
export YOLO_MODE=true # to bypass the safety confirmation prompt when running shell commands

# or ...

export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...

code-puppy --interactive
```
Running in a super weird corporate environment? 

Try this:
```bash
export MODEL_NAME=my-custom-model
export YOLO_MODE=true
export MODELS_JSON_PATH=/path/to/custom/models.json
```

```json
{
    "my-custom-model": {
        "type": "custom_openai",
        "name": "o4-mini-high",
        "max_requests_per_minute": 100,
        "max_retries": 3,
        "retry_base_delay": 10,
        "custom_endpoint": {
            "url": "https://my.custom.endpoint:8080",
            "headers": {
                "X-Api-Key": "<Your_API_Key>",
                "Some-Other-Header": "<Some_Value>"
            },
            "ca_certs_path": "/path/to/cert.pem"
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` env variable must be set when using `custom_openai` endpoints.

Open an issue if your environment is somehow weirder than mine.

Run specific tasks or engage in interactive mode:

```bash
# Execute a task directly
code-puppy "write me a C++ hello world program in /tmp/main.cpp then compile it and run it"
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
- Gemini API key (for Google's Gemini models)
- Cerebras API key (for Cerebras models)
- Anthropic key (for Claude models)
- Ollama endpoint available

## Agent Rules
We support AGENT.md files for defining coding standards and styles that your code should comply with. These rules can cover various aspects such as formatting, naming conventions, and even design guidelines.

## Using MCP Servers for External Tools

Code Puppy supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** to give you access to external code tools and advanced features like code search, documentation lookups, and more‚Äîincluding Context7 (https://context7.com/) integration for deep docs and search!

### What is an MCP Server?
An MCP server is a standalone process (can be local or remote) that offers specialized functionality (plugins, doc search, code analysis, etc.). Code Puppy can connect to one or more MCP servers at startup, unlocking these extra commands inside your coding agent.

### Configuration
Create a config file at `~/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`. Here‚Äôs an example that connects to a local Context7 MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
     "context7": { 
        "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/sse"
     }
  }
}
```

You can list multiple objects (one per server).

### How to Use
- Drop the config file in `~/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`.
- Start your MCP (like context7, or anything compatible).
- Run Code Puppy as usual. It‚Äôll discover and use all configured MCP servers.

#### Example usage
```bash
code-puppy --interactive
# Then ask: Use context7 to look up FastAPI docs!
```

That‚Äôs it!
If you need to run more exotic setups or connect to remote MCPs, just update your `mcp_servers.json` accordingly.

**NOTE:** Want to add your own server or tool? Just follow the config pattern above‚Äîno code changes needed!

## Conclusion
By using Code Puppy, you can maintain code quality and adhere to design guidelines with ease.
