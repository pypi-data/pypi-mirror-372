## Migration Guide

### From aceflow-server v1.x

```bash
# Old configuration (automatically compatible)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aceflow-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["aceflow-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}

# New configuration (recommended)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aceflow-unified": {
      "command": "aceflow-unified",
      "args": ["serve", "--mode", "basic"]
    }
  }
}
```

### From aceflow-enhanced-server v1.x

```bash
# Old configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aceflow-enhanced-server": {
      "command": "uvx", 
      "args": ["aceflow-enhanced-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}

# New configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aceflow-unified": {
      "command": "aceflow-unified",
      "args": ["serve", "--mode", "enhanced"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Migration

The unified server automatically detects and migrates existing configurations:

```bash

aceflow-unified config --migrate

# Verify migration
aceflow-unified config --validate
```
