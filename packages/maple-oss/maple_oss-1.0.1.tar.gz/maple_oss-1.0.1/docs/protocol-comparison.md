### 🔵 Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A): Limited Platform

#### Strengths
- ✅ Well-integrated with Google Cloud ecosystem
- ✅ Enterprise-grade infrastructure support
- ✅ Good documentation and developer tools

#### Critical Limitations
- ❌ **Google Ecosystem Lock-in**: Only works within Google's infrastructure

- ❌ **Basic Error Handling**: Uses conventional exception patterns
- ❌ **Limited Security**: Only OAuth-based platform security
- ❌ **No State Management**: Requires external state management systems
- ❌ **Performance Limitations**: ~50K msg/sec maximum throughput

#### Technical Constraints
```python
# Google A2A limitations - this is ALL you get
from google_a2a import Agent, Message

# Basic message (NO resource specification possible)
message = {
    "type": "process_request",
    "data": data,
    # ❌ No resource requirements
    # ❌ No security beyond OAuth
    # ❌ No state synchronization
    # ❌ Basic error handling only
}

# Simple send (NO Result<T,E> pattern)
try:
    response = agent.send(message)  # May fail silently
    # ❌ No structured error information
    # ❌ No recovery suggestions
    # ❌ No resource optimization
except Exception as e:
    # ❌ Generic exception handling only
    print(f"Something went wrong: {e}")
```

#### Use Cases
- Google Cloud-based applications
- Simple function-calling between Google services
- Applications already committed to Google ecosystem

- ❌ **Legacy Type System**: Primitive data types, no modern constructs
- ❌ **No Resource Management**: Cannot handle modern resource requirements
- ❌ **Limited Scalability**: Struggles with >100 agents

#### Technical Obsolescence  
```python
# FIPA ACL - ancient and limited
from fipa_acl import Message, Agent

# Ancient message format (1990s technology)
message = ACLMessage(
    performative=ACLMessage.REQUEST,
    content="(action (agent1 (process data)))",  # Ancient syntax
    # ❌ No resource specification
    # ❌ No modern error handling
    # ❌ No security features
    # ❌ No state management
    # ❌ No performance optimization
)

# Basic sending (primitive error handling)

#### Technical Scope Limitations
```python
# MCP - limited to sequential model interactions
from mcp import Client, Tool

# Sequential tool calling (NO parallel coordination)
client = MCP.Client()
result = client.call_tool("analyze_data", {"data": data})

# ❌ No resource specification
# ❌ No multi-agent coordination  
# ❌ No distributed state management
