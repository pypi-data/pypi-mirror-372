## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

[`NEAR`](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/NEAR) (*neural embeddings for amino acid relationships*) 
is a method developed by Daniel Olson *et al.*[\[1\]](#ref1) to generate
meaningfull residue-level embeddings for proteins, which can then be used
for nearest-neighbor search in high-dimensional space.

`mininear` is a pure-Python package to encode protein sequences into NEAR 
embeddings, using the trained weights from the NEAR ResNet, and a portable
re-implementation of ResNet using NumPy (and code derived from the 
[`numpy-ml`](https://github.com/ddbourgin/numpy-ml) project).

This library only depends on NumPy and is available for all modern Python
versions (3.7+).

<!-- ### üìã Features -->


## üîß Installing

Install the `mininear` package from GitHub, until a PyPI release is made 
available:
```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/althonos/mininear
```

<!-- Install the `mininear` package directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mininear)
which hosts universal wheels that can be installed with `pip`:
```console
$ pip install mininear
``` -->

<!-- Otherwise, `mininear` is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda mininear
``` -->

<!-- ## üìñ Documentation

A complete [API reference](https://mininear.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)
can be found in the [online documentation](https://mininear.readthedocs.io/),
or directly from the command line using
[`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html):
```console
$ pydoc mininear
``` -->

## üí° Example

`mininear` provides a single `Encoder` class, which can be used to encode
a sequence using the NEAR ResNet:
```python
import mininear

encoder = mininear.Encoder()
embedding = encoder.encode_sequence("MLELLPTAVEGVSQAQITGRPEWIWLALGTALMGLGTL...")
```

The embedding for that sequence is returned as a NumPy array. Currently
there is no batching support, but this is planned if that is a desirable
feature.
