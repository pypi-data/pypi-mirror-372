result = aion.maths.sigmoid([0, 1, -1])  # [0.5, 0.731, 0.269]
correlation = aion.maths.correlation([1,2,3,4], [2,4,6,8])  # 1.0
matrix_det = aion.maths.determinant([[1,2],[3,4]])  # -2.0

# 🔗 AI Embeddings & Similarity
embedding = aion.embed.embed_text("Machine learning research")
similarity = aion.embed.cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)

# 📊 Model Evaluation
metrics = aion.evaluate.calculate_classification_metrics(y_pred, y_true)
reg_metrics = aion.evaluate.calculate_regression_metrics(pred, true)

# 🧠 Code Analysis
explanation = aion.code.explain_code("def train_model(): pass")
