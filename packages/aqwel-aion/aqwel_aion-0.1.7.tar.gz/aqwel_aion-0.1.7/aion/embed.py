ðŸ”— Aqwel-Aion v0.1.7 - Text Embeddings & Vector Similarity Module
================================================================

ðŸš€ NEW IN v0.1.7 - PROFESSIONAL EMBEDDING CAPABILITIES:
This module was completely rewritten for v0.1.7 to provide state-of-the-art
text embedding capabilities for AI research and NLP applications.

ðŸŽ¯ WHAT WAS ADDED IN v0.1.7:
- âœ… embed_text(): Advanced text embedding using Sentence Transformers
- âœ… embed_file(): File content embedding with automatic text extraction  
- âœ… cosine_similarity(): Professional vector similarity calculations
- âœ… Intelligent fallback system when sentence-transformers unavailable
- âœ… Hash-based embedding fallback using MD5 for consistent results
- âœ… Full NumPy integration for vector operations
- âœ… Production-ready error handling and type hints

ðŸ”¬ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Primary: Uses sentence-transformers with 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model (384 dimensions)
- Fallback: Hash-based embedding using MD5 for consistent numerical vectors
- Vector operations: Professional cosine similarity with proper normalization
- File handling: Automatic encoding detection and text extraction

ðŸ’¡ PERFECT FOR AI RESEARCHERS:
This module enables researchers to quickly generate embeddings for semantic search,
document similarity, clustering, and other NLP tasks without complex setup.

    ðŸ”— NEW IN v0.1.7: Generate high-quality embeddings for text using Sentence Transformers.
    
    This function converts text into dense vector representations suitable for semantic
    similarity, clustering, search, and other NLP tasks. Uses state-of-the-art 
    transformer models with intelligent fallback for environments without GPU support.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Input text to convert to embedding vector
        model_name (str): HuggingFace model name for embeddings
                         Default: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" (384 dimensions, balanced speed/quality)
                         Other options: "all-mpnet-base-v2" (768 dim, higher quality)
                                      "paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2" (384 dim, paraphrase detection)
        
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Dense vector embedding of shape (384,) or (768,) depending on model
                   Values are typically normalized to unit length for cosine similarity
        
    Technical Details:
        - Uses sentence-transformers library when available for professional embeddings
        - Falls back to MD5-based deterministic hash embedding (384-dim) when unavailable
        - Embeddings are cached internally by sentence-transformers for efficiency
        - Output vectors are suitable for cosine similarity, dot product, and clustering
        
    Examples:
        >>> # Basic text embedding
        >>> embedding = embed_text("Machine learning is transforming AI research")
        >>> print(embedding.shape)  # (384,)
        >>> print(type(embedding))  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
        
        >>> # Compare semantic similarity
        >>> text1 = "Neural networks are powerful"
        >>> text2 = "Deep learning models are effective" 
        >>> emb1, emb2 = embed_text(text1), embed_text(text2)
        >>> similarity = cosine_similarity(emb1, emb2)
        >>> print(f"Similarity: {similarity:.3f}")  # High similarity expected

        >>> high_quality = embed_text("Research paper abstract", "all-mpnet-base-v2")
        >>> print(high_quality.shape)  # (768,)
        
    Raises:
        UnicodeDecodeError: If text contains invalid characters
        RuntimeError: If model loading fails (rare with fallback system)
        
    Performance Notes:
        - First call loads model (~50MB download), subsequent calls are fast
        - GPU acceleration automatic if CUDA available
        - Batch processing recommended for multiple texts (use model.encode([texts]))

    ðŸ”— NEW IN v0.1.7: Calculate cosine similarity between two embedding vectors.
    
    Computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of
    their directional similarity. This is the standard metric for comparing text
    embeddings, document similarity, and semantic search applications.
    
    Args:

        vec2 (np.ndarray): Second embedding vector (must match vec1 dimensions)
        
    Returns:

               -1.0 = Opposite direction (perfect dissimilarity)
               
    Mathematical Formula:
        cosine_sim = (A Â· B) / (||A|| Ã— ||B||)
        Where Â· is dot product and ||Â·|| is vector magnitude
        
    Examples:
        >>> # Compare similar text embeddings
