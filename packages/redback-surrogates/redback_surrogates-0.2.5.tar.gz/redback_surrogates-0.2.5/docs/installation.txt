      Supported python versions: 3.7+.


This will install all requirements for running :code:`redback_surrogates` for creating models and the data required to use these models.
Currently :code:`redback_surrogate` is going significant development, and we can not guarantee that any `pip` or `conda` releases will be completely upto date.
Therefore, for the near future, we recommend installing :code:`redback_surrogate` from source, and in development mode.

Install :code:`redback_surrogates` from source
-------------------------

:code:`redback_surrogate` is developed and tested with Python 3.7+. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, `python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing>`_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

Clone the repository, install the requirements, and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback_surrogates
   $ cd redback_surrogates/
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install .

To install with development mode, use:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback_surrogates
   $ cd redback_surrogates/
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install -e .

For full functionality, please also install optional requirements.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -r optional_requirements.txt

You are now ready to use redback_surrogate. Please check out the `examples <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/tree/master/examples>`_

Install through :code:`redback`
-------------------------

If you install optional requirements in :code:`redback`, :code:`redback_surrogate` will be installed automatically.
For instructions on installing :code:`redback`, please see the `redback installation instructions <https://redback.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.
