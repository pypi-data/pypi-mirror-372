We provide several different examples so users can get a more practical grasp of how to use :code:`redback`.
The :code:`redback_surrogate` models follow the same API as the :code:`redback` models, so the examples for the :code:`redback` models can be easily modified to use the :code:`redback_surrogate` models.

Please see these examples `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/>`_.
Replacing the models in many cases will be as simple as changing the model string.
