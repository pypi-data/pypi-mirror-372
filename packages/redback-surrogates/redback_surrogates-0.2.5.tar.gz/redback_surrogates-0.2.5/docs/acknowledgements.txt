The paper describing :code:`redback` is now out. :code:`redback_surrogates` is a part of :code:`redback`.
If you use :code:`redback_surrogate` in a scientific publication please cite the :code:`redback` paper.

Using :code:`redback_surrogates` to evaluate a model
-------------------------

Plenty of :code:`redback_surrogates` models build on other open-source packages. The appropriate citation if using such models in scientific publication is available as an attribute to the model.

For example,

.. code:: python

    from redback_surrogates.kilonova_models import kasen_bns_kilonovanet_spectra.prior
    import numpy as np

    citation = kasen2017.citation

Here citation will be a url to the NASA ads page for the paper describing the model/surrogate.
Please cite this paper and the paper describing :code:`redback` if using this model in a scientific publication.
Note that the responsibility of citing the appropriate papers lies with the user.

In several cases, the citation will be `redback`, in which case,
only a citation to :code:`redback` paper is necessary.
Although we recommend periodically checking the citation in the latest :code:`redback_surrogates` release as some models are often updated.
