# nuvom/queue_backends/base.py

"""
Abstract base class defining the interface for job queue backends.

This class enforces implementation of core queue operations:
- enqueue: add a job to the queue.
- dequeue: remove and return a job with optional timeout.
- pop_batch: remove and return multiple jobs at once.
- qsize: query the current number of jobs in the queue.
- clear: remove all jobs from the queue.

Concrete backend implementations must override all abstract methods.
