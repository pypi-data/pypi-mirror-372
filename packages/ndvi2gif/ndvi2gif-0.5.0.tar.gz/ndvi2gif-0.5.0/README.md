**Ndvi2Gif** is a Python library designed to simplify access to global satellite data through the Google Earth Engine platform. While its name highlights the ability to create seasonal GIF animations, the true power of this tool lies in its capability to compute and export pixel-wise statistics for any region on Earth, across any time span covered by supported remote sensing datasets.

Built on top of [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api) and [Geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap), it allows you to:

- Generate annual or multi-annual composited rasters (e.g., median NDVI per season between 2001 and 2020),
- Apply multiple statistics (mean, max, flexible percentiles) across space and time,
- Export results as GeoTIFFs for further analysis,
- Retrieve zonal statistics over user-defined geometries,
- Monitor vegetation structure with advanced SAR indices,
- Handle incomplete years automatically for real-time monitoring,
- And yes ‚Äî also create colorful GIFs for easy visualization.

Whether you're monitoring crop phenology, detecting harvest events, assessing drought trends, or preparing input layers for further ecological modeling, `ndvi2gif` makes it easier to extract reliable, multi-temporal remote sensing information at scale.

Ndvi2Gif was updated and extended as part of its integration into the eLTER and SUMHAL projects, which also enabled the use of eLTER site boundaries (via `deimsPy`) as one of its input sources.

## ‚ú® What's New in v0.5.0

The **0.5.0 release** takes *Ndvi2Gif* from a seasonal compositing tool to a **full-featured remote sensing analysis suite**.  
You still get everything you had before ‚Äî effortless access to **Sentinel-1/2/3, Landsat, MODIS**, flexible statistics, and GIF/GeoTIFF exports ‚Äî but now with a whole new layer of analytical power:

### üöÄ All the classics, better than ever

- Seasonal & multi-annual composites of NDVI, NDWI, EVI, and 40+ indices  
- Flexible statistics: mean, median, max, percentiles  
- Multi-sensor support across optical and SAR missions  
- Easy ROI handling from drawn geometries, shapefiles, DEIMS IDs, or tile codes  
- Exports to **GeoTIFFs** and **GIF animations** for instant visualization  

### üî• Brand-new in 0.5.0

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Sentinel-1 ARD Processor** ‚Äì professional SAR preprocessing with terrain correction and a suite of speckle filters  
- üìà **TimeSeriesAnalyzer** ‚Äì extract robust time series, test for trends (Mann-Kendall, Sen‚Äôs slope, linear), and visualize dynamics with multi-panel dashboards  
- üå± **Extended NdviSeasonality** ‚Äì dynamic temporal periods (4, 12, 24, custom), smarter ROI handling, SAR normalization, and improved sensor-index validation  
- üé® **Polished Visualizations** ‚Äì publication-ready layouts with unified Seaborn/Matplotlib styling  

With this release, *Ndvi2Gif* is not just about generating composites ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **understanding change**:  
phenology cycles, long-term trends, vegetation structure, and water quality dynamics.

## Why use Ndvi2Gif?

Unlike many visualization-oriented tools, Ndvi2Gif is designed as a **remote sensing analytics suite** that abstracts much of the complexity of working directly with Google Earth Engine, while giving you the flexibility to go far beyond GIF creation.

You can:

- **Access pixel-wise statistics** over any Earth location, at any scale and time span.  
  - Example: *Obtain the monthly median of the 85th NDVI percentile per pixel from 1984 to 2024 using Landsat data.*  
  - Example: *Calculate the maximum of the seasonal NDWI maximums between 2017 and 2023 using Sentinel-2.*  
  - Example: *Monitor crop harvest timing with bi-monthly VV/VH ratio analysis using Sentinel-1.*  
  - Example: *Track daily algal blooms with Sentinel-3 OLCI turbidity indices.*  

- **Perform nested aggregations**:  
  First compute temporal summaries (e.g., per-season percentiles or means), then apply a second statistical reduction across years (e.g., median, min, max).

- **Run advanced time series analysis** with the new `TimeSeriesAnalyzer`:  
  - Trend detection (Mann-Kendall, Sen‚Äôs slope, linear regression)  
  - Multi-panel dashboards (seasonal patterns, autocorrelation, data quality)  
  - Phenology metrics such as Start/End of Season, Peak, Length, amplitude, and rates of change  

- **Preprocess Sentinel-1 SAR like a pro** with the `S1ARDProcessor`:  
  - Radiometric terrain correction for mountainous regions  
  - Multiple speckle filtering options (Boxcar, Lee, Refined Lee, Gamma-MAP, Lee Sigma)  
  - Flexible DEM support (Copernicus and SRTM)  

- **Target any ecological or phenological metric** by choosing the appropriate index and analysis pipeline.

- **Work globally**, without needing to download or preprocess raw satellite data ‚Äî all computations are handled via Earth Engine's cloud infrastructure.

- **Handle real-time monitoring** with automatic detection of available data periods for incomplete years.

In other words: if you can describe a temporal range, a spatial region, an index, and a chain of statistics ‚Äî `ndvi2gif` can not only generate it, but now also help you **analyze and interpret the changes over time**.

Yes, it makes nice GIFs ‚Äî but it's much more than that.

- [Landsat 5 TM](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LT05_C02_T1_L2)

**MODIS (Surface Reflectance):**

- [MOD09A1 (SR)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD09A1)

You can combine any of the supported indices, datasets, and statistical methods. By default, the tool uses NDVI with the **maximum** statistic to avoid cloud contamination. However, **median** and **custom percentiles** are often visually better for Landsat datasets and specific applications.

Note: **Sentinel-2** uses Surface Reflectance, **Sentinel-3** uses Level-1B TOA radiance (optimized for aquatic applications), while **Landsat and MODIS** use Surface Reflectance (SR) for superior atmospheric correction and scientific quality.

The tool generates rasters with 4 (seasons), 12 (months), or 24 (custom periods) bands per year.

Beyond creating a nice-looking animated GIF, this multi-seasonal compositing method provides insights into vegetation dynamics, phenology, land cover, and more. High values in all seasons (white tones) typically mean perennial vegetation, while low values (dark tones) might represent water, soil, or impervious surfaces.

## GeoTIFF Export

You can also export seasonal composites as GeoTIFF files for further analysis. Multi-year composites are supported as well. For example, you can export median NDVI per season for all of Africa between 2001‚Äì2020, bi-monthly VV/VH ratios for crop monitoring, or daily Sentinel-3 turbidity indices for water quality assessment.
