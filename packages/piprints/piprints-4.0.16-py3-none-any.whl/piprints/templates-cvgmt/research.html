Welcome to the HomePage of the Research Group in Calculus of
Variations and Geometric Measure Theory at Pisa.<br>
The group includes several mathematicians from<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sns.it">Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa</a>
<li><a href="http://www.dm.unipi.it">Mathematics Department of University of Pisa</a>
<li><a href="http://www.dma.unipi.it">Department of Applied Mathematics of University of Pisa</a>
</ul>
Our research interest is the study of variational
problems and of their applications to Geometry and to Mechanics.<br>
A list of fields in which the group has made active research in the
last years is: <br>
<i>
- Gamma-convergence<br>
- Optimal control problems<br>
- Functionals defined on spaces of measures<br>
- Semicontinuity, relaxation and integral representation of 
local functionals<br>
- Shape optimization problems<br>
- Regularity of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations<br>
- Properties of Sobolev and BV functions<br>
- Free-boundary problems<br>
- Evolution by mean curvature<br>
- Analysis in metric spaces<br>
- Theory of currents and varifolds<br>
- Functionals on spaces of manifolds<br>
- Geometric evolution problems<br>
- Nonlinear problems in geometry<br>
- Variational methods in image and data analysis<br>
- Problems in elasticity and continuum mechanics<br>
