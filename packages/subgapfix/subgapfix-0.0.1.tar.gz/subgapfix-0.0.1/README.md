# SubGapFix

A small Python CLI tool to **extend subtitle durations** in `.srt` files so they stay on screen longer and feel more natural to read.  
Designed especially for subtitles generated by [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX), which often have very tight timings.

## âœ¨ Features

- Automatically extends subtitles when thereâ€™s a gap before the next subtitle.  
- Prevents overlaps by adjusting start/end times safely.  
- Configurable via CLI arguments.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/subgapfix.git
cd subgapfix
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Dependencies:

* [`srt`](https://pypi.org/project/srt/)

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
python subgapfix.py input.srt -o easyreading.srt
```

### Options

| Option                     | Default         | Description                                                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-o, --output`             | `subgapfix.srt` | Output SRT file                                                           |
| `--extend-sub-start, -ess` | `0.5`           | Seconds to add to start of subtitle. Default is `0.5`                     |
| `--extend-sub-end, -ese`   | `2.0`           | Maximum seconds to add to end of subtitle. Default is `2.0`               |
| `--min-gap, -mg`           | `1.0`           | Minimum gap (in seconds) required to apply extension. Default is `1.0`    |


### How It Works

The script reads your `.srt` file, loops through each pair of consecutive subtitles, and adjusts their timings to make them easier to read.  

### Example

Input:

```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello there.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How are you?
```

Run:

```bash
python subgapfix.py input.srt -o fixed.srt
```

Output:

```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello there.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
How are you?
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why?

Tools like WhisperX produce accurate subtitles, but their timings are often too **tight** for comfortable reading.
`SubGapFix` helps subtitles stay visible longer while keeping synchronization intact.
