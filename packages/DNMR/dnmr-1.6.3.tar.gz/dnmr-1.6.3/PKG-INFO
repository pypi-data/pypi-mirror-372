# DNMR

The *Data Analysis, Visualisation, and Interpretation Software for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance* (DAVISNMR, or more simply **DNMR**) is a piece of software including a GUI to read and analyse files generated by the frappy-Tecmag NMR interface described [here](https://www.psi.ch/en/lin/nmr-spectroscopy-0).

### Features
- Quick comparison of completely separate datasets (parallel viewing and handling)
- Equally quick loading and combination of separate-but-related datasets for analysis (live concatenation of datasets) 
- Auto or manual data re-phasing, both for individual data points or in bulk
- View time-domain and frequency-domain data
- Apply easily-customisable filters to time-domain data
- Common NMR analysis workflows including T<sub>1</sub> fitting, field scans, and inverse Laplace transforms (ILTs)
- Export processed data into an easy-to-handle CSV format
- Easily extensible framework for custom analyses
- Limited support for .TNT files natively generated by Tecmag's TNMR program

### Installation
This software is available on Pip:
```
python -m pip install DNMR
```

### Running
Simply load the software as a module. For example:
```
python -m DNMR
```
Any additional arguments will be loaded as datafiles into the zero-th channel. I.e., if you wanted to load "test_file_0p25K.hdf" and "test_file_1K.hdf" together, you'd run:
```
python -m DNMR test_file_0p25K.hdf test_file_1K.hdf
```
(one could also just use the buttons and dialogs in the GUI)

### Modification

To add new tabs, there are a few different steps:
1. Read through `tab.py`. This is the class that your new tab will be inheriting from.
    a. Take specific note of the functions `generate_layout`, `plot_logic`, and `get_exported_data`. These are the functions you'll override.
    b. Notice that every tab is given a matplotlib axis, `self.ax`, a reference to `data_widgets['fileselector']` (`self.fileselector`), and a shared pool of other tabs, `self.data_widgets`, which it adds itself to upon construction.
2. Create a new file, `example_tab.py` for example.
    a. "Fill in" the functions listed above. Don't forget to supercall the Tab constructor
    b. Feel free to take functionality from `miniwidgets.py`, pull data from other widgets (from `data_widgets[X].data`, for example; these tabs are all designed under a "friendly" architecture, in C++ terms), and separate `plot_logic` and `update` calls intelligently.
3. Once you're happy with some basic functionality, edit the `__main__.py` file.
    a. In the MainWindow `__init__` function, you'll need to create your tab with the rest of them.
    b. After creation, you must add your tab to the `tabwidget_tabs` object so that it will be loaded as a functional tab.
    
Once you've completed the above, you should see your tab in the main window. 

### Notes

If you're editing the code, it may be most useful to `git clone` the repository, then `pip install -e .` inside, to create a suitable development environment. I learned about this functionality through this project, so you might too :)
