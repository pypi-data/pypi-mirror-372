# DNMR

The *Data Analysis, Visualisation, and Interpretation Software for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance* (DAVISNMR, or more simply **DNMR**) is a piece of software including a GUI to read and analyse files generated by the frappy-Tecmag NMR interface described [here](https://www.psi.ch/en/lin/nmr-spectroscopy-0).

### Features
- Quick comparison of completely separate datasets (parallel viewing and handling)
- Equally quick loading and combination of separate-but-related datasets for analysis (live concatenation of datasets) 
- Auto or manual data re-phasing, both for individual data points or in bulk
- View time-domain and frequency-domain data
- Apply easily-customisable filters to time-domain data
- Common NMR analysis workflows including T<sub>1</sub> fitting, field scans, and inverse Laplace transforms (ILTs)
- Export processed data into an easy-to-handle CSV format
- Easily extensible framework for custom analyses
- Limited support for .TNT files natively generated by Tecmag's TNMR program

### Installation
This software is available on Pip:
```
python -m pip install DNMR
```

### Running
Simply load the software as a module. For example:
```
python -m DNMR
```
Any additional arguments will be loaded as datafiles into the zero-th channel. I.e., if you wanted to load "test_file_0p25K.hdf" and "test_file_1K.hdf" together, you'd run:
```
python -m DNMR test_file_0p25K.hdf test_file_1K.hdf
```
(one could also just use the buttons and dialogs in the GUI)
