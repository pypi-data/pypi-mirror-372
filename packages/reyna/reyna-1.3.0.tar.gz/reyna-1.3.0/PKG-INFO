# reyna

A lightweight Python package for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using polygonal discontinuous 
Galerkin finite elements, providing a flexible and efficient way to approximate solutions to complex PDEs.

### Features

- Support for various polygonal element types (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
- Easy-to-use API for mesh generation, assembly, and solving PDEs.
- High performance with optimized solvers for large-scale problems.
- Supports both linear and nonlinear equations.
- Extensible framework: easily integrate custom element types, solvers, or boundary conditions.

### Installation

You can install the package via pip. First, clone the repository and then install it using pip:

Install from PyPI:

```shell
pip install reyna
```

Install from source:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/mattevs24/reyna.git
```

## Example Usage

### Create a Simple Mesh

A simple example to begin with is the `RectangleDomain` object. This requires just the bounding
box as an input. In this case, we consider the unit square; $[0, 1]^2$. We then use `poly_mesher` 
to generate a bounded Voronoi mesh of the domain. This uses Lloyd's algorithm, which can produce
edges that are machine precision in length. To avoid this for benchmarking and other critical 
purposes, use the `cleaned` keyword, set to `True`.

```python
import numpy as np

from reyna.polymesher.two_dimensional.domains import RectangleDomain
from reyna.polymesher.two_dimensional.main import poly_mesher

domain = RectangleDomain(bounding_box=np.array([[0, 1], [0, 1]]))
poly_mesh = poly_mesher(domain, max_iterations=10, n_points=1024)
```

### Generating the Geometry Information

The DGFEM code requires additional information about the mesh to be able to run, including which edges
are boundary edges and their corresponding normals as well as information on a given subtriagulation to 
be able to numerically integrate with the required precision. This is done using the `DGFEMgeometry` function.

```python
from reyna.geometry.two_dimensional.DGFEM import DGFEMGeometry

geometry = DGFEMGeometry(poly_mesh)
```

### Defining the Partial Differential Equation

To define the PDE, we need to call the DGFEM object. We then add data in the form of the general
coefficients for a (up-to) second order PDE of the form

$$
-\nabla\cdot(a\nabla u) + b\cdot\nabla u + cu = f
$$

where $a$ is the diffusion tensor, $b$ is the advection vector, $c$ is the reation functional and
$f$ is the forcing functional. All of these functions must be able to take in a (N, 2) array of 
points and output tensors of the correct shape; (N, 2, 2), (N, 2), (N,) and (N,) respectively. An 
example is given

```python
def diffusion(x):
    out = np.zeros((x.shape[0], 2, 2), dtype=np.float64)
    for i in range(x.shape[0]):
        out[i, 0, 0] = 1.0
        out[i, 1, 1] = 1.0
    return out

advection = lambda x: np.ones(x.shape, dtype=float)
reaction = lambda x: np.pi ** 2 * np.ones(x.shape[0], dtype=float)
forcing = lambda x: np.pi * (np.cos(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 1]) +
                             np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.cos(np.pi * x[:, 1])) + \
                    3.0 * np.pi ** 2 * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 1])

solution = lambda x: np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 1])
```

We use the solution function here as the boundary conditions for the solver.

### Adding data and Assembly

We can now call the solver, add the data and assemble.

```python

from reyna.DGFEM.two_dimensional.main import DGFEM

dg = DGFEM(geometry, polynomial_degree=1)

dg.add_data(
    diffusion=diffusion,
    advection=advection,
    reaction=reaction,
    dirichlet_bcs=solution,
    forcing=forcing
    )

dg.dgfem(solve=True)
```

Setting the `solve` input to `True` generates the solution vector. If this is `False`, just the
stiffness matrix and data vector are generated.

### Visualize the solution

We also have a method to plot the data, `plot_DG`, but this is limited to polynomial degree 1
with limited support for polynomial degree 0. See the example below

```python
dg.plot_DG()
```

or for more customisation, use the function `plot_DG`,

```python
from reyna.DGFEM.two_dimensional.plotter import plot_DG

plot_DG(dg.solution, geometry, dg.polydegree)
```

For the given example, we have the solution plot

### Benchmarking

We have a benchmarking file that may be run availible in the main DGFEM directory. But we also provide
an example of the code to be able to calculate yourself

```python

def grad_solution(x: np.ndarray):
    u_x = np.pi * np.cos(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 1])
    u_y = np.pi * np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 0]) * np.cos(np.pi * x[:, 1])

    return np.vstack((u_x, u_y)).T

dg_error, l2_error, h1_error = dg.errors(
    exact_solution=solution,
    div_advection=lambda x: np.zeros(x.shape[0]),
    grad_exact_solution=grad_solution
)
```

Often, the error rate is calcuated against the maximal cell diameter; the code for this is included in
the `DGFEM` class under the `h` method as well as the `DGFEMgeometry` class under the `h` method (`DGFEMgeometry` 
additionally contains all the local values of `h` across the mesh).

```python
h = dg.h
h = geometry.h
```

Note that in a purely advection/diffusion problem, some of the norms are unavailable and return
a `None` value.

## A more advanced Domain Example

There are many predefined domains in the `reyna/polymesher/two_dimensional/domains` folder including this
more advanced `CircleCircleDomain()` domain;

## Example Notebooks

There are Jupyter notebooks availible in the GitHub repository which run through several examples of this
package in action. This also runs through examples of benchmarking and custom domain generation.

## Documentation

For detailed usage and API documentation, please visit our (soon to be) readthedocs. 
The above example and notebooks cover most cases and the current docstrings are very thorough.

and Atomic Energy Commission. A Special thanks to the support of Ansar Calloo, Fraçois Madiot throughout
the PhD so far. A further thank you to my interal supervisors Tristan Pryer and Luca Zanetti for their role

## Upcoming Updates

There are many features that remain to add to this code! We hope to add support for the following features

- Mixed-type problems: support for multiple types of PDE on the same domain.
- Full readthedocs documentation to support the further developement and use of this package.
