              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Mongo Orchestration
-------------------

See the `wiki <https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration/wiki>`__
for documentation.

Mongo Orchestration is an HTTP server that provides a REST API for
creating and managing MongoDB configurations on a single host.

**THIS PROJECT IS FOR TESTING OF MONGODB DRIVERS.**

Features
--------

-  Start and stop mongod servers, replica sets, and sharded clusters on the host running mongo-orchestration.
-  Add and remove replica set members.
-  Add and remove shards and mongos routers.
-  Reset replica sets and clusters to restart all members that were
   stopped.
-  Freeze secondary members of replica sets.
-  Retrieve information about MongoDB resources.
-  Interaction all through REST interface.
-  Launch simple local servers using ``mongo-launch`` CLI tool.

Requires
--------

-  `Python >=3.8 <http://www.python.org/download/>`__
-  `bottle>=0.12.7 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottle>`__
-  `pymongo>=3.0.2,<4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo>`__
-  `cheroot>=5.11 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cheroot/>`__

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Mongo Orchestration is with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__:

::

    pip install mongo-orchestration

You can also install the development version of Mongo Orchestration
manually:

::

    git clone https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration.git
    cd mongo-orchestration
    pip install .

Cloning the `repository <https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration>`__ this way will also give you access to the tests for Mongo Orchestration as well as the ``mo`` script. Note that you may
have to run the above commands with ``sudo``, depending on where you're
installing Mongo Orchestration and what privileges you have.
Installation will place a ``mongo-orchestration`` script on your path.

Usage
-----

::

    mongo-orchestration [-h] [-f CONFIG] [-e ENV] [--no-fork] [-b BIND IP="localhost"] [-p PORT]
                        [-s {auto,cheroot,wsgiref}] [--socket-timeout-ms MILLIS]
                        [--pidfile PIDFILE] [--enable-majority-read-concern] {start,stop,restart}


Arguments:

-  **-h** - show help
-  **-f, --config** - path to config file
-  **-e, --env** - default release to use, as specified in the config
   file
-  **--no-fork** - run server in foreground
-  **-b, --bind** - host on which Mongo Orchestration and subordinate mongo processes should listen for requests. Defaults to "localhost".
-  **-s, --server** - HTTP backend to use: one of `auto`, `cheroot`, or `wsgiref`. `auto`
   configures bottle to automatically choose an available backend.
-  **-p** - port number (8889 by default)
-  **--socket-timeout-ms** - socket timeout when connecting to MongoDB servers
-  **--pidfile** - location where mongo-orchestration should place its pid file
-  **--enable-majority-read-concern** - enable "majority" read concern on server versions that support it.
-  **start/stop/restart**: start, stop, or restart the server,
   respectively

In addition, Mongo Orchestration can be influenced by the following environment variables:

- ``MONGO_ORCHESTRATION_HOME`` - informs the
  server where to find the "configurations" directory for presets as well
  as where to put the log and pid files.
- ``MONGO_ORCHESTRATION_TMP`` - the temporary folder root location.
- ``MO_HOST`` - the server host (``localhost`` by default)
- ``MO_PORT`` - the server port (8889 by default)
- ``MONGO_ORCHESTRATION_CLIENT_CERT`` -  set the client certificate file 
  to be used by ``mongo-orchestration``.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

``mongo-orchestration start``

Starts Mongo Orchestration as service on port 8889.

``mongo-orchestration stop``

Stop the server.

``mongo-orchestration -f mongo-orchestration.config -e 30-release -p 8888 --no-fork start``

Starts Mongo Orchestration on port 8888 using ``30-release`` defined in
``mongo-orchestration.config``. Stops with *Ctrl+C*.

If you have installed mongo-orchestration but you're still getting
``command not found: mongo-orchestration`` this means that the script was
installed to a directory that is not on your ``PATH``. As an alternative use:

``python -m mongo_orchestration.server start``

Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mongo Orchestration may be given a JSON configuration file with the
``--config`` option specifying where to find MongoDB binaries. See
`mongo-orchestration.config <https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration/blob/master/mongo-orchestration.config>`__
for an example. When no configuration file is provided, Mongo
Orchestration uses whatever binaries are on the user's PATH.

Predefined Configurations
-------------------------

Mongo Orchestration has a set of predefined
`configurations <https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration/tree/master/mongo_orchestration/configurations>`__
that can be used to start, restart, or stop MongoDB processes. You can
use a tool like ``curl`` to send these files directly to the Mongo
Orchestration server, or use the ``mo`` script in the ``scripts``
directory (in the `repository <https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration>`__ only). Some examples:

-  Start a single node without SSL or auth:

   ::

       mo configurations/servers/clean.json start

-  Get the status of a single node without SSL or auth:

   ::

       mo configurations/servers/clean.json status

-  Stop a single node without SSL or auth:

   ::

       mo configurations/servers/clean.json stop

-  Start a replica set with ssl and auth:

   ::

       mo configurations/replica_sets/ssl_auth.json start

-  Use ``curl`` to create a basic sharded cluster with the id
   "myCluster":

   ::

       curl -XPUT http://localhost:8889/v1/sharded_clusters/myCluster \
                  -d@configurations/sharded_clusters/basic.json

Note that in order to run the ``mo`` script, you need to be in the same
directory as "configurations".

**Helpful hint**: You can prettify JSON responses from the server by
piping the response into ``python -m json.tool``, e.g.:

::

    $ curl http://localhost:8889/v1/servers/myServer | python -m json.tool

    {
        "id": "myServer",
        "mongodb_uri": "mongodb://localhost:1025",
        "orchestration": "servers",
        "procInfo": {
            "alive": true,
            "name": "mongod",
            "optfile": "/var/folders/v9/spc2j6cx3db71l/T/mongo-KHUACD",
            "params": {
                "dbpath": "/var/folders/v9/spc2j6cx3db71l/T/mongo-vAgYaQ",
                "ipv6": true,
                "journal": true,
                "logappend": true,
                "oplogSize": 100,
                "port": 1025
            },
            "pid": 51320
        },
        // etc.
    }

Mongo Launch
------------

The ``mongo-launch`` CLI tool allows you to spin up servers locally
with minimal configuration.

..

    mongo-launch --help
    Usage: launch.py [single|replica|shard] [ssl] [auth]

..

    mongo-orchestration start
    mongo-launch replica ssl auth
