PyDy_, short for Python Dynamics, is a tool kit written in the Python
programming language that utilizes an array of scientific programs to enable
the study of multibody dynamics. The goal is to have a modular framework that
can provide the user with their desired workflow, including:

- Model specification
- Equation of motion generation
- Simulation
- Visualization
- Benchmarking
- Publication

.. _PyDy: http://pydy.org

We started by building the SymPy_ `mechanics package`_ which provides an API
for building models and generating the symbolic equations of motion for complex
multibody systems. More recently we developed two packages, `pydy.codegen` and
`pydy.viz`, for simulation and visualization of the models, respectively.  This
Python package contains these two packages and other tools for working with
mathematical models generated from SymPy mechanics. The remaining tools
currently used in the PyDy workflow are popular scientific Python packages such
as NumPy_, SciPy_, IPython_, Jupyter_, ipywidgets_, pythreejs_, and matplotlib_
which provide additional code for numerical analyses, simulation, and
visualization.
