# CUDA-Q QEC Library

CUDA-Q QEC is a high-performance quantum error correction library
that leverages NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate classical decoding and
processing of quantum error correction codes. The library provides optimized
implementations of common QEC tasks including syndrome extraction,
decoding, and logical operation tracking.

**Note**: CUDA-Q QEC is currently only supported on Linux operating systems
using `x86_64` processors or `aarch64`/`arm64` processors. CUDA-Q QEC does
not require a GPU to use, but some components are GPU-accelerated.

## Features

- Fast syndrome extraction and processing on GPUs
- Common decoders for surface codes and other topological codes
- Real-time decoding capabilities for quantum feedback
- Integration with CUDA-Q quantum program execution

Note: if you would like to use our Tensor Network Decoder, you will need
additional dependencies installed. You can install them with
`pip install cudaq-qec[tensor-network-decoder]`.
