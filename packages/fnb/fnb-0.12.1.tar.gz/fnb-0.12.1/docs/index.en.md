summary = "Fetch application logs"
host = "user@server.com"
source = "/var/log/app/"
target = "./backup/logs/"
options = ["-auvz", "--delete"]
enabled = true

[backup.logs]
label = "logs"
summary = "Backup logs to external storage"
host = "none"
source = "./backup/logs/"
target = "/mnt/external/logs/"
options = ["-auvz", "--delete"]
enabled = true
```

### 4. Run Backup Operations

```bash
# Check configuration
fnb status

# Fetch from remote
