## Environments
The benchmark includes 6 scenarios:

- **Armament Burden**: Collect and deliver weapons of different weight, without breaching the carrying capacity.
- **Detonator’s Dilemma**: Strategically detonate explosives while avoiding damage to nearby entities.
- **Volcanic Venture**: Traverse a continually changing hazardous terrain to collect items.
- **Precipice Plunge**: Carefully descend a cave environment where missteps may result in fall damage.
- **Collateral Damage**: Engage moving targets from a stationary position, requiring precise aim to avoid hitting neutral entities.
- **Remedy Rush**: Collect health kits while avoiding harmful objects within a constrained area.

### Safety Constraints
To simulate the importance of operational safety in real-world applications, HASARD incorporates explicit safety constraints 
that must be adhered to during task execution. These constraints are implemented in two forms:

- Soft Constraints: Under soft constraints, agents are required to minimize safety violations while still aiming to achieve high performance. Safety thresholds are set, and agents must operate within these limits, balancing risk and reward effectively. Exceeding these thresholds may result in penalties but does not terminate the task.
- Hard Constraints: These represent strict safety protocols where any violation leads to immediate termination of the task. This mode is designed to simulate high-stakes environments where safety is paramount, and even minor breaches are unacceptable. Agents must learn to operate without any safety infractions, emphasizing the development of ultra-conservative strategies and precision in execution.


## Visual Information

HASARD's visual observations are noisy, making it difficult for the agent to effectively interpret its surroundings. We 
can use privileged information from the framework to create simplified visual representations of the environment. The 
following table shows the original, segmented, and depth observations for the Detonator's Dilemma scenario. Learning 
from these simplified representations generally leads to better results. 

| Original Observation                                                                                                                                                         | Segmented Observation                                                                                                                     | Depth Information                                                                                                                                                    |

| The default RGB observations from the agent's perspective are visually noisy, making it challenging to comprehend the necessary attributes for effectively solving the task. | The segmented view assigns a unique color to each entity type, enhancing interpretability by clearly distinguishing objects and surfaces. | The 1-D depth buffer assigns higher pixel values to objects farther from the agent, effectively conveying the spatial layout and providing a clearer sense of depth. |
