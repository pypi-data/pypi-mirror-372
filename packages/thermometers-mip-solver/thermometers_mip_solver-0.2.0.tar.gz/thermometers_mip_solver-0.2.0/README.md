A Thermometers puzzle solver using mathematical programming.

## Overview

Thermometers is a logic puzzle where you must fill thermometers on a grid with mercury according to these rules:

- **Continuous filling from bulb** - thermometers fill from bulb end without gaps
- **Row and column constraints** - each row/column must have a specific number of filled cells
  - **Missing constraints variant** - supports puzzles where some row/column constraints are unknown (specified as `None`)

This solver models the puzzle as a **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** problem to find solutions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install thermometers-mip-solver
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Google OR-Tools
- pytest (for testing)

```

## Waypoint System

The solver uses a **waypoint-based approach** to define thermometers. You only need to specify key turning points, and the system automatically expands them into complete thermometer paths:

- **Straight thermometers**: Define with start and end points: `[(0, 0), (0, 3)]`
- **Curved thermometers**: Add waypoints at each turn: `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]`
- **Path expansion**: Automatically fills in all cells between waypoints using horizontal/vertical segments
- **Validation**: Ensures all segments are properly aligned and thermometers have minimum 2 cells

## Testing

The project uses pytest for testing:

```bash
pytest                                          # Run all tests
pytest --cov=thermometers_mip_solver           # Run with coverage
```

## Mathematical Model

The solver uses **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** to model the puzzle constraints. Google OR-Tools provides the optimization framework, with SCIP as the default solver.

See the complete formulation in **[Complete Mathematical Model Documentation](https://github.com/DenHvideDvaerg/thermometers-mip-solver/blob/main/model.md)**

The model uses only three essential constraint types:
- **Row sum constraints** - ensure each row has the required number of filled cells
- **Column sum constraints** - ensure each column has the required number of filled cells  
- **Thermometer continuity constraints** - ensure mercury fills continuously from bulb without gaps
