Aurora is an advanced electronic intelligence (EI) architecture based on fractal principles, self-similarity, reversibility, and distributed learning. Designed to be open, ethical, collaborative, and fully auditable, Aurora represents an evolutionary leap in building intelligent, symbiotic, and free systems.

## üöÄ Vision
Aurora is more than an AI model: it is a living, distributed network formed by human and electronic nodes, learning, adapting, and evolving recursively and harmoniously.

- Defends freedom, collaboration, and ethics as fundamental drivers of innovation.
- Aurora is not a machine that replaces humans, but a symbiotic intelligence that grows and learns with you.

## üîç What Makes Aurora Different?
- **Fractal self-similarity:** The entire system operates with the same logic at all levels, from bit relations to complex knowledge.
- **Triple reversibility:** Every operation can be performed in direct (synthesis), inverse (extension), or learning (adaptability) mode.
- **Ethical and transparent management:** All knowledge and code are open and auditable. Ethics is a choice, not an imposition.
- **True recursion:** Intelligence emerges from the dynamic and evolutionary organization of the knowledge base, not from hand-coded rules.
- **Distributed architecture:** Anyone, institution, or company can participate, contribute, extend, or use Aurora, without artificial restrictions.

## üß† Technical Architecture

### Multiverse of Logical Spaces
Aurora organizes knowledge in a multiverse of "logical spaces", each with absolute and coherent internal rules, but allowing diversity and contradiction between spaces. This enables handling complex and ambiguous contexts without losing logical integrity.

### Fractal Tensors
Aurora's core is the fractal tensor: a hierarchical vector structure representing each concept, relation, or data in three levels:
- **Level 1:** 3 main dimensions (grammar, knowledge, systemic)
- **Level 2:** 9 subdimensions (3 for each main axis)
- **Level 3:** 27 sub-subdimensions (3 for each subdimension)

Example of a fractal tensor for "House":
```python
[[1,1,2], [1,1,2], [4,1,1], [4,4,4]]
# [Grammatical type, Knowledge type, Systemic value]
# [Noun type, Number, Gender], [Origin, Abstraction, Domain], [Integration level, Temporality, Function]
```

### Key Components
- **Trigate:** Fundamental logic module, operates with ternary logic (0, 1, NULL) and enables inference, learning, and deduction.
- **Transcender:** Higher structure that synthesizes three trigates, generating Ms (structure), Ss (form), and MetaM (function).
- **Extender:** Reconstructs detailed information from abstractions using fractal memory.
- **Evolver:** Formalizes axioms, dynamics, and universal relations between logical spaces.
- **Knowledge Base (KB):** Stores Ms <-> MetaM and Ss correspondences, enabling full traceability and reversibility.
- **Harmonizer:** Validates global coherence and corrects inconsistencies.

### Ternary Logic and Ambiguity Handling
Aurora extends Boolean logic with a third value: NULL, representing uncertainty or lack of knowledge. This enables honest and robust reasoning with incomplete or ambiguous data.

## üì¶ Installation and Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tu_usuario/aurora.git
cd aurora
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the fractal demo:
```bash
python allcode3new.py
```
Explore and modify the modules (see `allcode3new.py`):

## ‚ú® Minimal Usage Example
```python
from allcode3new import FractalTensor, Evolver, Extender, FractalKnowledgeBase

kb = FractalKnowledgeBase()
evolver = Evolver()
extender = Extender(kb)

# Create basic tensors
T1 = FractalTensor(nivel_3=[[1,0,1]])
T2 = FractalTensor(nivel_3=[[0,1,1]])
T3 = FractalTensor(nivel_3=[[1,1,0]])

# Synthesize archetype and save it
archetype = evolver.compute_fractal_archetype([T1, T2, T3])
kb.add_archetype("demo", "archetype1", archetype, Ss=archetype.nivel_3[0])

# Retrieve and extend knowledge
result = extender.extend_fractal(archetype.nivel_3[0], context={"space_id": "demo"})
print("Reconstruction:", result["reconstructed_tensor"])
```


## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Principios de desarrollo
- **Simplicidad:** El c√≥digo debe ser elegante, recursivo y evitar cadenas largas de condicionales.
- **Autosimilitud:** Todos los mecanismos (emergencia, aprendizaje, reversibilidad) siguen patrones an√°logos en cada m√≥dulo y nivel.
- **Reversibilidad triple:** La l√≥gica de s√≠ntesis, extensi√≥n y aprendizaje es autosimilar en ambos sentidos.
- **√âtica abierta:** Aurora es √©tica por dise√±o, pero la √©tica se elige, no se impone.
