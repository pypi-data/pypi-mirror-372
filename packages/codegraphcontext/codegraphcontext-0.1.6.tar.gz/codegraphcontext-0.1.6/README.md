# CodeGraphContext

An MCP server that indexes local code into a graph database to provide context to AI assistants.

## Features

-   **Code Indexing:** Analyzes Python code and builds a knowledge graph of its components.
-   **Relationship Analysis:** Query for callers, callees, class hierarchies, and more.
-   **Live Updates:** Watches local files for changes and automatically updates the graph.
-   **Interactive Setup:** A user-friendly command-line wizard for easy setup.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install:** `pip install codegraphcontext`
2.  **Setup:** `cgc setup`
3.  **Start:** `cgc start`
4.  **Index Code:** `cgc tool add-code-to-graph '{"path": "/path/to/your/project"}'`

## MCP Client Configuration

Add the following to your MCP client's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CodeGraphContext": {
      "command": "cgc",
      "args": [
        "start"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "************",
        "NEO4J_USER": "************",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "**************"
      },
      "tools": {
        "alwaysAllow": [
          "list_imports",
          "add_code_to_graph",
          "add_package_to_graph",
          "check_job_status",
          "list_jobs",
          "find_code",
          "analyze_code_relationships",
          "watch_directory",
          "find_dead_code",
          "execute_cypher_query"
        ],
        "disabled": false
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Natural Language Interaction Examples

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through your AI assistant using plain English. Here are some examples of what you can say:

### Indexing and Watching Files

-   **To index a new project:**
    -   "Please index the code in the `/path/to/my-project` directory."
    OR
    -   "Add the project at `~/dev/my-other-project` to the code graph."


-   **To start watching a directory for live changes:**
    -   "Watch the `/path/to/my-active-project` directory for changes."
    OR
    -   "Keep the code graph updated for the project I'm working on at `~/dev/main-app`."

    When you ask to watch a directory, the system performs two actions at once:
    1.  It kicks off a full scan to index all the code in that directory. This process runs in the background, and you'll receive a `job_id` to track its progress.
    2.  It begins watching the directory for any file changes to keep the graph updated in real-time.

    This means you can start by simply telling the system to watch a directory, and it will handle both the initial indexing and the continuous updates automatically.

### Querying and Understanding Code

-   **Finding where code is defined:**
    -   "Where is the `process_payment` function?"
    -   "Find the `User` class for me."
    -   "Show me any code related to 'database connection'."

-   **Analyzing relationships and impact:**
    -   "What other functions call the `get_user_by_id` function?"
    -   "If I change the `calculate_tax` function, what other parts of the code will be affected?"
    -   "Show me the inheritance hierarchy for the `BaseController` class."
    -   "What methods does the `Order` class have?"

-   **Exploring dependencies:**
    -   "Which files import the `requests` library?"
    -   "Find all implementations of the `render` method."

-   **Code Quality and Maintenance:**
    -   "Is there any dead or unused code in this project?"
