		"Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga provides one with Fame, Property, and Control usually. But all the said prosperities will be used by the native only in the next half of life particularly after the age 36 corresponding to the age at the yoga developing dasha, sub-period and transits take place in oneâ€™s chart. This typical nature is attributed to this Yoga because the planet who create Neecha Bhanga Rajayoga is subjected to debilitation first and then attains the cancellation. Likewise, the native's life too would suffer adversities in the initial part of life and then will start excelling. Earning from multiple sources and earning a good reputation from a vast number of peoples and various communities along with holding a good image is the result of this Yoga. One will be admired within his/her personal, professional and social circles. Whatever they do brings a good reputation for them and people usually like them for what they are. They will gather huge property and start producing many sources of income once the Rajayoga is in operation. They will also hold power in life. The native will be holding power over many people once this Yoga is operational."]
