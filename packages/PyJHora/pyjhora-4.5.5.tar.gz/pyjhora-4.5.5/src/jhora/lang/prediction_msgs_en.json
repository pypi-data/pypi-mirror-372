	 ["If the lord of Lagna is weak or debilitated or combust, the native will become sickly and grotesque in appearance. He becomes evil-minded, poor and infamous. and will serve others. When the lord of Lagna is in the 12th in the Navamsa, the person will always be roaming about and suffers of mind and body.",
	 "There will be acquisition of wealth if Lagnadhipathi is in the 2nd with the 2nd lord. He will also acquire silver and goldware and other precious metals and stones according to the nature of the lord. He will succeed in all his attempts. The family will expand and he will have a peaceful and happy time. In spite of Lagnadhipathi being fortified as above, if he occupies 6th, 8th or 12th in the Navamsa from the sign held by the 2nd lord, there will be a lessening of the above effects.",
	 "There will be birth of brothers or prosperity to them, mental peace, and connection with pleasure-loving persons of both sexes. Enmity with brothers or sorrow to them may be anticipated when Lagnadhipathi occupies 6th, 8th or 12th from the lord of the 3rd in the Navamsa.",
	 "Acquisition of vehicles, valuable clothes, cattle, houses and lands, construction of new houses, and respect from friends and relatives, acquaintance with learned men and discussions with them and formation of new friendshipsâ€” all these will happen if Lagnadhipathi is well fortified and occupies the 4th with the 4th lord. He incurs enmity with his mother and near relatives and sustains accident and gets involved in legal troubles if Lagnadhipathi is in the 6th. 8th or 12th in the Navamsa from the 4th lord.",
	 "One will earn the grace of the ruler or the Government of the day if Lagnadhipathi is in the 5th with the 5th lord, well fortified. There will be mental peace. He will become the leader of his community. Consistent with the strength of the Lagna and 5th lords, he may become either an Ambassador or a Minister, or a high Government official. There will also be birth of a son. Political prosperity may be anticipated. Quite opposite results may be anticipated if the lord of Lagna occupies the 6th, 8th or 12th from lord of the 5th in the Navamsa. There will be reverses in the political or official career of the individual.",
	 "When the lord of Lagna is in the 6th with 6th lord, one suffers from all kinds of physical ailments, wounds, enmity with rulers, failure, misunderstandings with cousins, legal troubles, poverty, wounds from weapons and physical distress. If, however, in the Navamsa, the 6th lord is debilitated and lord of Lagna is exalted, favourable results may be anticipated. Tbe person may enter the Army. He will vanquish his enemies. He will succeed in litigation. When, however, the lord of Lagna is in the 6th, 8th or 12th in the Navamsa from the 6th lord, then favourable results will be minimised and tbe unfavourable results will not predominate.",
	 "When the lord of Lagna is in the 7th in conjunction with the 7th lord, the native will have pilgrimage. If unmarried, he will have marriage. When the 7th house is a movable sign, he will undertake journeys to distant countries ; if fixed, in his own country ; and if common, to foreign countries. If Lagnadhipathi is weaker than the lord of the 7th, journeys undertaken would prove profitless. When the lord of Lagna is in the 6th, 8th or 12th from the 7th lord in the Navamsa, the person will be deprived of means of livelihood, defamed and will have misunderstandings with his wife. There will be failure, loss of business and general deterioration in all his affairs.",
	 "If the lord of Lagna joins the 8th lord in the 8th, the native suffers misery and poverty. He will lead a sinful life and contract debts. He will always be thinking of evil things. When the lord of the 8th is rendered weak, the evil results are minimised. But he will resort to sinful life in a clandestine manner.",
	 "When the Lagnadhipathi joins the 9th lord in the 9th, father will be happy during the Dasa of the Lagnadhipathi. He will do righteous acts and will be devoted to his parents and elders. Contrary results may be anticipated if the Navamsa positions are adverse. He will develop atheistic tendencies. There will be litigation troubles with regard to ancestral property. When either of the lords is exalted, there will be influx of much wealth and expenditure on desirable and deserving causes.",
	 "When the lord of Lagna joins the 10th lord in the 10th, the native performs sacri6ces and other religious deeds consistent with his beliefs. He will also get a good administrative or political job. He will become more theistic and wield considerable influence in high circles. If the dispositions are adverse in Navamsa, he will lose respect and will be a victim of slander and will commit sinful acts.",
	 "When the lord of Lagna joins the 11th lord in the 11th, there will be much gain from trade. The elder brother will be happy and through him the native will benefit. The nature and sources of gains will be consistent with the Karaka indications of the planets concerned. When the dispositions are adverse in Navamsa, the gains will be less. There will be misunderstandings with elder brother. The exact nature of the strength and weakness of the two lords must be cleverly balanced before coming to a decision.",
	 "When lord of Lagna joins the 12th lord in the 12th, he will lose all ancestral property. Poverty will stare him-He will roam about in exile. He will be subject to all sorts of financial difficulties. If, however, Lagnadhipathi is in his own Navamsa, he will slightly benefit in foreign countries, i.e., he will earn some money. When the lord of the Navamsa sign held by Lagnadhipathi is exalted in a Chara Rasi, there will be considerable amassing of fortune."
	 ],
	 "2":["The native becomes no doubt wealthy but he hates his own family, lacks polite manners, becomes passionate, subservient and time-serving. When the lord of the 2nd is in Lagna, one will earn money by his own effort, intelligence and learning or he will get inherited wealth if the 9th lord or the Sun has anything to do with this combination.",
	 "Becomes proud. The native may marry twice or thrice depending upon the strength of the seventh house. He may become childless. The position of the 2nd lord in a constellation which does not happen to be the 3rd, 5th and 7th from Janma Nakshatra is highly desirable, especially if he is otherwise fortified, i.e., joined with or aspected by benefics. The exaltation of the 2nd lord of his disposition in Lagna, the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th or 10th, will fortify him to the extent of making him a yogakaraka. The native will be enabled to earn considerable fortune through business or other occupations consistent with the nature of the 2nd lord and 2nd house. Depending upon the nature of the aspects cast on the 2nd lord by malefic planets, the native will sustain losses. An affliction to the 2nd lord may also express itself in the shape of the subject not getting nutritious and delicious food, or his family and children suffering from constant diseases, or want of cordial relations between the native and his life-partner.",

He will also indulge in propitiating Kshudra Devatas or evil spirits.",

When the 2nd lord in the 4th is well fortified, one will earn well as an automobile dealer or agent or an agriculturist or landlord or commission agent. He will also be benefited by his maternal relations. There will be losses on this account if the 4th lord is afflicted.",
	 "Hating family, sensual, not spending money even on children, he lacks manners and etiquette. When the 2nd lord in the 5th is well fortified there will be unexpected acquisition of wealth through lotteries, crosswords, or the favour of rulers.",
	 "Income and expenditure from enemies. He will suffer from defects or diseases in the anus and thighs. Amassing of wealth by black-marketing, deceit, dissimulation and by creating misunderstandings and troubles between friends and relatives and through questionable and suspicious dealings can be anticipated if the second lord joins the 6th and is well fortified. If afflicted, he will be involved in these troubles and sentenced for such crimes as breach of trust, forgeries and perjuries.",
	 "Likely to become a healer. Laxity of morals will mark both husband and wife. He will waste much money on the gratification of the senses. When the second lord who joins the 7th with the 7th lord is strong there will be influx of wealth through foreign sources. The native will undertake journeys to foreign countries and do business. When the Rasi, Navamsa or the constellation held by the 2nd lord happens to be a feminine one, then he will benefit by contact with women.",
	 "Will have very little or no happiness from wife or husband. Misunderstandings with elder brothers. Gets landed properties. When the 2nd lord is strong, there will be influx as well as loss of wealth. Actual observation reveals that under such a combination, there will hardly be any earnings, but inherited or accumulated wealth will disappear.",
	 "Skilful, ill-health in young age but healthy afterwards, will possess lot of wealth and become happy. When the 2nd lord is well fortified and the 9th lord is in Lagna, the native will have good inheritance. There will also be benefits through different sources according to the nature of the sign and nakshatra held by the 2nd lord.",
	 "Respect from elders and superiors, learned, wealthy and he earns by his own exertions. The native will take to a number of useful avocations. He will do business or take to agriculture and also engage himself in philosophical lectures and dissertations, and thereby benefit financially. Here again, the constellation and the sign held by the 2nd lord determine the exact nature and sources of earnings. Powerful afflictions will cause loss from the very same sources.",
	 "Health will be bad during childhood, earns considerable wealth but becomes unscrupulous. When well fortified, one earns by lending money or as a banker or by running a boarding house.",
	 "The native becomes a respectable man. In all probability he will be a government servant, and will be deprived of the happiness of elder brother. The income will be through ecclesiastical sources. If the second lord is afflicted, he will lose money on this account."

	 "This is an unfavourable position as it makes the subject rather unscrupulous unless there are other favourable combinations. He will make advances on the women and wealth of others. Likes mean deeds and is generally devoid of happiness. He is likely to lose his younger brothers.",
	 "Brave, surrounded by friends, relatives, blessed with good children, wealthy, happy and contented. The 3rd lord well disposed in the 3rd, 6th or 11th indicates a number of younger brothers. When the 3rd lord happens to be Mars and occupies the 3rd, then, generally, the native will lose all his younger brothers. Saturn will also give similar effects. The Sun in a similar position will kill elder brothers.",
	 "If the lord of the 3rd is in the 4th, life will be happy on the whole. He becomes rich and learned. But the wife will be cruel-hearted and mean. When the lord of the 3rd is well fortified in the 4th and the lords of Lagna and 9th are rendered weak, his brothers will survive him. He will have step-brothers if the 9th lord is strong. When Mars is weak he will lose his lands and he will have to live in others' houses. Evil results will be minimised if the 3rd house is beneficially disposed.",
	 "Much pleasure will not be derived from children. Financially well off in life. Friction will prevail in the domestic life.
