It's like Badgie, but for **tags!**

## About

taggie tags things. It's what it does.

taggie is built as a standalone tool to be integrated into a larger toolchain
for analyzing and acting on project contents.

## Installation

```sh
python3 -m pip install taggie
```

## Usage

### Write some rules

Define a set of tagging rules in YAML files we like to call "tag files":

```yaml
# jinja.yaml
- type: file.extension
  tags:
    - jinja
  filters:
    - language
  extensions:
    - j2
```

The taggie project has a set of pre-defined rules in the `tag_files` directory.

### Run `taggie`

Run `taggie` with the `-t`/`--tag-file` option to specify your tag files. A
directory can also be passed. `-t`/`--tag-file` can be specified as many times
as needed:

```sh
taggie -t jinja.yaml
```

```console
$ taggie -t jinja.yaml
TOTAL    NAME    EXAMPLE
11       jinja   gitlab/.cici/README.md.j2
```

I apparently have 11 Jinja templates in the directory where I ran the tool.

The syntax is a little verbose, but that's because we want to make the tagging
components pluggable.
