# Zettelkasten Package Name Proposals: Lord of the Rings Inspiration

## Purpose

This document presents and analyzes potential package names for our Zettelkasten-based model catalog system, drawing inspiration from Lord of the Rings while applying professional naming principles. The goal is to identify a name that embodies the system's purpose of connecting knowledge, discovering relationships between components, and supporting model development and selection.

## Naming Approach

The proposed names follow the principles of evocative naming as outlined in the Igor Naming Guide, focusing on creating distinctive, meaningful names with marketing potential rather than merely descriptive or invented terms. Each name has been evaluated based on:

1. **Positioning alignment** with our knowledge management system
2. **Depth** of meaning and associations
3. **Distinctiveness** in the ML/AI tooling space
4. **Energy** and marketing potential
5. **A.S.S. Count** (Associations + Slogans Score)
6. **PyPI availability** for immediate package registration

## PyPI Availability and Pronunciation Summary

We've checked the availability of our proposed names on the Python Package Index (PyPI):

### Available Names:
- ✅ **athelas** — Pronounced "ah-THEL-as" (emphasis on second syllable)
- ✅ **miruvor** — Pronounced "MEER-oo-vor" (emphasis on first syllable)
- ✅ **ithilien** — Pronounced "ith-ILL-ee-en" (emphasis on second syllable)
- ✅ **rivendell** — Pronounced "RIV-en-dell" (emphasis on first syllable)
- ✅ **orthanc** — Pronounced "OR-thank" (emphasis on first syllable)
- ✅ **imladris** — Pronounced "im-LAD-ris" (Elvish name for Rivendell)
- ✅ **ithil** — Pronounced "ITH-il" (Elvish word for "moon", root of Ithilien)
- ✅ **mithral** — Pronounced "MITH-ral" (variant spelling of mithril)

### Unavailable Names:
- ❌ **palantir** — Pronounced "pa-LAN-teer" (emphasis on second syllable)
- ❌ **palantiri** — Pronounced "pa-LAN-teer-ee" (plural form)
- ❌ **mithril** — Pronounced "MITH-ril" (emphasis on first syllable)

> **Note on Elvish Pronunciation**: The "th" in Tolkien's languages is always pronounced as in "think," never as in "this". Vowels are generally pure, and the letter "r" is slightly trilled in Elvish fashion.
