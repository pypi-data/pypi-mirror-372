# scikit-learn Stubs

This repository simply publishes the stubs from [Microsoft's Python Type Stubs repository](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs) to PyPI.

I made this package because of a specific issue at work, in general you can simply install the stubs by following [the instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-our-stubs) given in the Microsoft repository.

## Installation

```bash
pip install scikit-learn-stubs
```
