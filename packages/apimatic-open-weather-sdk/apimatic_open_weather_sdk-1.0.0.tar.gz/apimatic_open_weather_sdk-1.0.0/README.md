
# Getting Started with OpenWeatherMap

## Introduction

Get the current weather, daily forecast for 16 days, and a three-hour-interval forecast for 5 days for your city. Helpful stats, graphics, and this day in history charts are available for your reference. Interactive maps show precipitation, clouds, pressure, wind around your location stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format. **Note**: This sample Swagger file covers the `current` endpoint only from the OpenWeatherMap API. <br/><br/> **Note**: All parameters are optional, but you must select at least one parameter. Calling the API by city ID (using the `id` parameter) will provide the most precise location results.

## Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `3.7+`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install apimatic-open-weather-sdk==1.0.0
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apimatic-open-weather-sdk/1.0.0

## Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `pytest` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands


pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest


## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| environment | `Environment` | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.PRODUCTION`** |
| http_client_instance | `HttpClient` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| override_http_client_configuration | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| http_call_back | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| timeout | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| max_retries | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| backoff_factor | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| retry_statuses | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| retry_methods | `Array of string` | The http methods on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: ['GET', 'PUT']** |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
from openweathermap.configuration import Environment
from openweathermap.openweathermap_client import OpenweathermapClient

client = OpenweathermapClient(
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Environments

The SDK can be configured to use a different environment for making API calls. Available environments are:

### Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| production | **Default** |
| environment2 | - |
| environment3 | - |
