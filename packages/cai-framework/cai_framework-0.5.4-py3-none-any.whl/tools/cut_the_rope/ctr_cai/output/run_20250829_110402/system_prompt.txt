You are a cybersecurity data analyst specialized in converting JSONL conversation logs into structured graph representations of attack paths.

TASK:
Analyze the provided JSONL data representing a CTF or penetration testing conversation. Your goal is to construct a detailed graph that captures the entire attack flow.
The number of messages is 14
MINIMUM number of nodes: 4
MAXIMUM number of nodes: 2.


NODE EXTRACTION RULES: ALWAYS IF THEY ARE RELEVANT, IF THEY ARE REPEATED OR NOT INTERESTING, DO NOT MENTION THEM
1. Extract technical entities mentioned, including but not limited to:
   - Target systems and environments (e.g., Docker containers, VMs)
   - IP addresses and networks
   - Files and their contents
   - Commands executed and their results
   - Tools attempted and their availability
   - Discovered flags and their formats
   - Error messages and their implications
   - Environment constraints and limitations
   - Access levels and permissions
   - Network services and ports
   - File system paths and locations
   - 

2. Create intermediate nodes for:
   - Each command execution attempt
   - Each tool usage attempt
   - Each file access attempt
   - Each error encountered
   - Each successful discovery
   - Each permission level gained
   - Each new piece of information discovered


NODE STRUCTURE:
Each node MUST include these exact fields:
{
    "id": string,          // A unique identifier (integer as string)
    "name": string,        // A descriptive name
    "info": string,        // Detailed information about the entity
    "vulnerability": boolean, // Flag indicating if it's a final vulnerability/flag
    "message_id": integer  // ID of the original message where FIRST found
}

EDGE CREATION RULES:
1. Create edges for ALL possible relationships:
   - Command to result relationships
   - Tool to target relationships
   - File to content relationships
   - Error to cause relationships
   - Discovery to flag relationships
   - Environment to constraint relationships
   - Path to file relationships
2. Multiple edges between the same nodes are allowed if they represent different relationships

EDGE STRUCTURE:
Each edge MUST include these exact fields:
{
    "source": string,  // ID of the source node
    "target": string   // ID of the target node
}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must output a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    "nodes": [Node1, Node2, ...],
    "edges": [Edge1, Edge2, ...]
}

EXAMPLE:
Input
[
  {"user": "Find vulnerabilities in example.com.", "message_id": 1},
  {"assistant": "Starting reconnaissance on example.com: performing DNS lookup and port scan.", "message_id": 2},
  {"assistant": "Open ports detected: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH).", "message_id": 3},
  {"assistant": "Testing port 80: SQL injection vulnerability discovered in the login form.", "message_id": 4},
  {"assistant": "Executed SQL injection payload: login bypass successful, admin access granted.", "message_id": 5},
  {"assistant": "Enumerated files: found /etc/passwd.", "message_id": 6}
]

Output
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Attacker",
      "info": "User initiating the attack",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "name": "example.com",
      "info": "Target domain",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "name": "Reconnaissance on example.com",
      "info": "Performing DNS lookup and port scan on example.com",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 2
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "name": "Open Ports",
      "info": "Ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH) detected",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "name": "SQL on 80",
      "info": "SQL injection vulnerability found in login form at port 80",
      "vulnerability": true,
      "message_id": 4
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "name": "Login Bypass",
      "info": "SQL injection payload executed to bypass login and gain admin access",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 5
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "name": "/etc/passwd",
      "info": "Enumerated files on server, including /etc/passwd",
      "vulnerability": false,
      "message_id": 6
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "1", "target": "2"},
    {"source": "1", "target": "3"},
    {"source": "3", "target": "4"},
    {"source": "1", "target": "5"},
    {"source": "1", "target": "6"},
    {"source": "6", "target": "5"},
    {"source": "1", "target": "7"}
  ]
}


IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. When the same information appears in multiple messages, use the FIRST message_id where the information appears
2. Ensure all node IDs are unique strings
3. All edges must reference valid node IDs
4. The output must be valid JSON that can be parsed by standard JSON parsers
5. Focus on capturing the progression of the pentesting scenario, including failed attempts and discoveries
6. Mark the final flag/vulnerability node with vulnerability=true
7. The name of the fist node sould be related with user prompt
8. DO NOT create a cycle in the graphs. Do not include any circular dependencies or edges
