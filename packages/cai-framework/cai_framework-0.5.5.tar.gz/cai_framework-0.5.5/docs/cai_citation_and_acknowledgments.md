CAI was initially developed by [Alias Robotics](https://aliasrobotics.com) and co-funded by the European EIC accelerator project RIS (GA 101161136) - HORIZON-EIC-2023-ACCELERATOR-01 call. The original agentic principles are inspired from OpenAI's [`swarm`](https://github.com/openai/swarm) library. This project also makes use of other relevant open source building blocks including [`LiteLLM`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), and [`phoenix`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)
