"""
Implementation of a Cyclic Swarm Pattern for Bug Bounty Triage Operations

This module establishes a coordinated multi-agent system where specialized agents
collaborate on vulnerability discovery and verification tasks. The pattern 
implements a directed graph of agent relationships, where each agent can transfer 
context (message history) to another agent through handoff functions, creating a 
complete communication network for comprehensive bug bounty and triage analysis.
