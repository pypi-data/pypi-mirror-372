# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Realtime Speech Python SDK

## About

This repository contains the source code for the Python SDK to connect to the Realtime Speech Service. There is also an example client to help with connecting to the service. \
This SDK is based on the popular [websockets](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets) python library.

## Installation

It is highly recommended that a Python virtual environment be used when installing the OCI Realtime Speech Python SDK.
Once your virtual environment is active, the SDK can be installed using pip. Do the following for installation:

```bash
pip install oci-ai-speech-realtime
```

## Development

Follow the instructions in the [Development Readme](ai-speech-realtime-sdk-python/README.md) to get started with local development/testing of the SDK code.

## Documentation

The home page for the OCI Speech Service can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/speech/).
The API reference for OCI Speech Service can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/speech/latest/).

Note that realtime speech URLs are distinct from the speech URLs mentioned in the above link. To obtain a realtime speech url, take a speech url, and replace 'speech' with realtime. Also replace https with wss.

For example, for the following speech url:

`https://speech.aiservice.af-johannesburg-1.oci.oraclecloud.com`

This is the corresponding realtime speech URL:

`wss://realtime.aiservice.af-johannesburg-1.oci.oraclecloud.com`

## Examples

We have an example here itself, it can be found in the [example-client](example-client/) directory.
