# Hermeneus: Intelligent Voice-to-Notes System

> **Listen to Speech, Understand Meaning, Generate Insight**

`Hermeneus` is an intelligent voice processing system powered by state-of-the-art speech recognition and large language models (LLM). It enables users to upload audio recordings, automatically transcribe them into text, and leverage LLMs to deeply understand semantics—transforming spoken words into structured, actionable smart notes, summaries, action items, or knowledge cards.

Whether it's meetings, lectures, interviews, or spontaneous ideas, Hermeneus turns your voice into valuable knowledge assets, dramatically enhancing information processing and personal knowledge management.

## Name Origin: Hermeneus — The Interpreter of Meaning

The name **"Hermeneus"** draws from **Hermes**, the messenger of the Greek gods—deity of communication, language, interpretation, wisdom, and technology. Hermes did not merely deliver messages; he **interpreted** their meaning, bridging gods and mortals.

In philosophy, the term *hermeneutics*—the theory and practice of interpretation—derives from Hermes. This is precisely the mission of our system:  
**To go beyond transcription, and toward true understanding.**

`Hermeneus` embodies:

- 🗣️ **The Bridge of Communication**: Connecting human speech with digital comprehension.  
- 🔍 **The Interpreter**: Extracting insight, context, and meaning from raw audio.  
- ⚡ **The Empowerer**: Harnessing the modern "fire" of AI—Whisper and LLMs—to transform voice into structured knowledge.

We believe intelligence lies not just in recognition, but in interpretation. `Hermeneus` is that principle in action: your voice’s wise interpreter.
