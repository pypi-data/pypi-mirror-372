#### MATPLOTLIBRC FORMAT

## This is a sample matplotlib configuration file - you can find a copy
## of it on your system in
## site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc.  If you edit it
## there, please note that it will be overwritten in your next install.
## If you want to keep a permanent local copy that will not be
## overwritten, place it in the following location:
## unix/linux:
##      $HOME/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc or
##      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matplotlib/matplotlibrc (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
## other platforms:
##      $HOME/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
##
## See http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html#the-matplotlibrc-file for
## more details on the paths which are checked for the configuration file.
##
## This file is best viewed in a editor which supports python mode
## syntax highlighting. Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment
## symbol, are ignored, as are trailing comments.  Other lines must
## have the format
##     key : val ## optional comment
##
## Colors: for the color values below, you can either use - a
## matplotlib color string, such as r, k, or b - an rgb tuple, such as
## (1.0, 0.5, 0.0) - a hex string, such as ff00ff - a scalar
## grayscale intensity such as 0.75 - a legal html color name, e.g., red,
## blue, darkslategray
