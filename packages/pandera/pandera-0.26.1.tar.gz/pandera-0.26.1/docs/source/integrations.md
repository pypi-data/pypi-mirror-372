# Integrations

Pandera ships with integrations with other tools in the Python ecosystem, with
the goal of interoperating with libraries that you know and love.

   * - :ref:`FastAPI <fastapi-integration>`
     - Use pandera DataFrameModels in your FastAPI app
   * - :ref:`Frictionless <frictionless-integration>`
     - Convert frictionless schemas to pandera schemas
   * - :ref:`Hypothesis <data-synthesis-strategies>`
     - Use the hypothesis library to generate valid data under your schema's constraints.
   * - :ref:`Mypy <mypy-integration>`
     - Type-lint your pandas and pandera code with mypy for static type safety [experimental ðŸ§ª]
   * - :ref:`Pydantic <pydantic-integration>`
     - Use pandera DataFrameModels when defining  your pydantic BaseModels
