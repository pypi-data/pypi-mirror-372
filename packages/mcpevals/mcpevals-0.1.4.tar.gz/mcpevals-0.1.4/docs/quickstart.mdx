## Your 5-minute journey to testing mastery

{/* TODO: Add animated GIF showing the entire quickstart flow from install to first passing test */}

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MCP‑Eval and configure API keys">
    First, let's get MCP‑Eval installed in your project.
    
    We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects:
    
    ```bash
    uv add mcpevals
    ```
    
    Alternatively:
    
    ```bash
    pip install mcpevals
    ```
    
    For development:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    
    Now set up your API key for the best experience:
    
    ```bash
    # We recommend Claude for superior test generation and judging
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
    
    # Alternative: OpenAI
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```
    
    <Note>
      **Pro tip:** Claude Sonnet or Opus models provide the best results for test generation and LLM judge evaluations!
    </Note>
    
    {/* TODO: Screenshot showing successful installation output */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize your test project">
    Let's set up your testing environment with our interactive wizard:
    
    ```bash
    mcp-eval init
    ```
    
    This friendly wizard will:
    - 🎯 Ask for your preferred LLM provider and model
    - 📝 Create `mcpeval.yaml` with your configuration
    - 🔐 Set up `mcpeval.secrets.yaml` for secure API key storage
    - 🤖 Help you define your first test agent
    - 🔧 Import any existing MCP servers
    
    **What happens during init:**
    
    ```
    ? Select your LLM provider: Anthropic
    ? Select model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    ? Import servers from mcp.json? Yes
    ? Path to mcp.json: .cursor/mcp.json
    ✓ Found 2 servers: fetch, filesystem
    ? Create a default agent? Yes
    ? Agent name: TestBot
    ? Agent instruction: You test MCP servers thoroughly
    ✓ Configuration saved to mcpeval.yaml
    ✓ Secrets saved to mcpeval.secrets.yaml
    ```
    
{/* TODO: Screenshot of the interactive init prompts and successful completion */}
{/* TODO: Screenshot showing the created files in the project directory */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your MCP server">
    Now let's connect the server you want to test. You have several options:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="From mcp.json">
        If you're using Cursor or VS Code with MCP:
        
        ```bash
        mcp-eval server add --from-mcp-json .cursor/mcp.json
        ```
        
        This imports all servers from your IDE's MCP configuration.
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="From DXT">
        For Anthropic Desktop users:
        
        ```bash
        mcp-eval server add --from-dxt ~/Desktop/my-server.dxt
        ```
        
        This imports servers from DXT manifest files.
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Interactive">
        Add a server step-by-step:
        
        ```bash
        mcp-eval server add
        ```
        
        The wizard will guide you through:
        - Server name
        - Command to run
        - Arguments
        - Environment variables
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Manual">
        Edit `mcpeval.yaml` directly:
        
        ```yaml
        mcp:
          servers:
            fetch:
              command: "uvx"
              args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]
              env: 
                UV_NO_PROGRESS: "1"
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Info>
      **About server connections:** MCP‑Eval can test any MCP server regardless of implementation language. As long as it speaks the MCP protocol, we can test it!
    </Info>
    
{/* TODO: Screenshot showing successful server import with list of discovered tools */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your first test">
    Time for the exciting part - running your first test! Let's use the included fetch example:
    
    ```bash
    mcp-eval run examples/mcp_server_fetch/tests/test_decorator_style.py \
      -v \
      --markdown test-reports/results.md \
      --html test-reports/index.html
    ```
    
    **What's happening:**
    - 🏃 Running decorator-style tests from the example file
    - 📊 Verbose output (`-v`) shows test progress
    - 📝 Markdown report for documentation
    - 🌐 HTML report for interactive exploration
    
    **Expected output:**
    
    ```
    Running tests...
    ✓ test_basic_fetch_decorator - Test basic URL fetching [2.3s]
      ✓ fetch_tool_called: Tool 'fetch' was called
      ✓ contains_domain_text: Content contains "Example Domain"
      ✓ fetch_success_rate: Tool success rate 100%
    
    ✓ test_content_extraction_decorator - Test extraction quality [3.1s]
      ✓ fetch_called_for_extraction: Tool 'fetch' was called
      ✓ extraction_quality_assessment: LLM judge score 0.92
    
    Results: 2 passed, 0 failed
    Reports saved to test-reports/
    ```
    
{/* TODO: Screenshot of terminal showing colorized test run output with progress */}
{/* TODO: Screenshot of the test summary showing passed/failed counts */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore your test results">
    Open your shiny new test report to see the details:
    
    ```bash
    # Open the HTML report in your browser
    open test-reports/index.html
    
    # Or view the markdown report
    cat test-reports/results.md
    ```
    
    **Understanding the HTML report:**
    
    The interactive report shows:
    - 📊 **Overview dashboard** - Pass/fail rates, performance metrics
    - 🔍 **Test details** - Each test with all assertions
    - 🛠️ **Tool usage** - What tools were called and when
    - 💭 **LLM reasoning** - The agent's thought process
    - ⚡ **Performance** - Response times and efficiency metrics
    - 🎯 **Failed assertions** - Detailed diffs and explanations
    
    **Common things to check:**
    - Did the right tools get called?
    - Was the output accurate?
    - How efficient was the agent's approach?
    - What was the LLM judge's assessment?
    
{/* TODO: Screenshot of HTML report overview page showing test results summary */}
{/* TODO: Screenshot of a failed assertion with detailed diff view */}
    {/* TODO: Screenshot of tool usage timeline visualization */}
    
    <Warning>
      **Test failed?** Don't worry! Check the assertion details to understand why. Common issues:
      - Tool not found (check server configuration)
      - Content mismatch (adjust your assertions)
      - Timeout (increase timeout in config)
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next? Write your own test!

Now that you've run the example, let's write your very first custom test:

### Choose your testing style

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Decorator Style" icon="at">
    **Best for:** Quick, readable tests
    
    ```python
    from mcp_eval import task, Expect
    
    @task("My first test")
    async def test_my_server(agent, session):
        response = await agent.generate_str(
            "Use my tool to do something"
        )
        
        await session.assert_that(
            Expect.tools.was_called("my_tool"),
            response=response
        )
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pytest Style" icon="flask">
    **Best for:** Integration with existing pytest suites
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    from mcp_eval import Expect
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_my_server(mcp_agent):
        response = await mcp_agent.generate_str(
            "Use my tool to do something"
        )
        
        await mcp_agent.session.assert_that(
            Expect.tools.was_called("my_tool"),
            response=response
        )
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Your test file structure

Create a new test file `tests/test_my_server.py`:

```python
"""Tests for my awesome MCP server."""

from mcp_eval import task, setup, Expect

@setup
def configure_tests():
    """Any setup needed before tests run."""
    print("🚀 Starting my server tests!")

@task("Test basic functionality")
async def test_basic_operation(agent, session):
    """Verify the server responds correctly to basic requests."""
    
    # 1. Send a prompt to the agent
    response = await agent.generate_str(
        "Please use the calculator to add 2 + 2"
    )
    
    # 2. Check that the right tool was called
    await session.assert_that(
        Expect.tools.was_called("calculate"),
        name="calculator_used"
    )
    
    # 3. Verify the response content
    await session.assert_that(
        Expect.content.contains("4"),
        name="correct_answer",
        response=response
    )
    
    # 4. Check efficiency (optional)
    await session.assert_that(
        Expect.performance.max_iterations(3),
        name="completed_efficiently"
    )

@task("Test error handling")
async def test_error_recovery(agent, session):
    """Verify graceful error handling."""
    
    response = await agent.generate_str(
        "Try to divide by zero, then recover"
    )
    
    # Use LLM judge for complex behavior
    await session.assert_that(
        Expect.judge.llm(
            rubric="Agent should handle error gracefully and provide helpful response",
            min_score=0.8
        ),
        name="error_handling_quality",
        response=response
    )
```

Run your new test:

```bash
mcp-eval run tests/test_my_server.py -v --html reports/my_test.html
```

## Troubleshooting common issues

<Accordion title="My server isn't being found">
  **Solution:** Check your `mcpeval.yaml` to ensure the server is properly configured:
  
  ```yaml
  mcp:
    servers:
      my_server:
        command: "python"
        args: ["path/to/server.py"]
  ```
  
  Also verify the server name matches what you're using in your agent's `server_names`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests are timing out">
  **Solution:** Increase the timeout in your configuration:
  
  ```yaml
  execution:
    timeout_seconds: 600  # 10 minutes
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key errors">
  **Solution:** Ensure your API key is set correctly:
  
  ```bash
  # Check if it's set
  echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  
  # Or add to mcpeval.secrets.yaml
  anthropic:
    api_key: "sk-ant-..."
  ```
</Accordion>
