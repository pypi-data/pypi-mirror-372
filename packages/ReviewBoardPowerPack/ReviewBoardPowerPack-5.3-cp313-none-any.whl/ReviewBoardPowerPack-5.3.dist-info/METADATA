===========================
Power Pack for Review Board
===========================

`Power Pack`_ enhances `Review Board`_ with new code and document review
capabilities, reports and analytics, and even more integrations.


.. _Power Pack: https://www.reviewboard.org/powerpack/
.. _Review Board: https://www.reviewboard.org/


Review documents and designs, not just code
===========================================

Source code is only one part of the software development process. PRDs, design
proposals, end-user technical documentation, and patent disclosures are just a
few of the numerous documents that get written, discussed, and edited along
the way.

Document review brings the same powerful, lightweight review process to PDF
files that developers have enjoyed for their source code. Documents are
displayed right in the browser without a need for any plug-ins or extra
software to be installed.


See how documents evolve through diffs
======================================

Nobody wants to re-read the same document with every new update. Instead,
focus only on what changed by diffing two revisions of the PDF document
side-by-side. All text changes made in the document will be highlighted in red
and green, much like a code diff.

The sidebar provides a quick reference of all the text changes throughout the
document, so you won't need to scroll through dozens or hundreds of pages
looking for changes.

Diffing works with any PDF documents containing embedded text. This includes
PDFs exported from Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and almost anything using
Print to PDF.


Track team productivity with reports
====================================

The best teams and organizations are always looking for ways to be even more
efficient, no matter how big or small they are. By getting insight into how
your developers are taking advantage of code review, you can develop more
cost-effective processes and policies, saving your team time and money.

Reports gives you several powerful ways of looking at how your developers are
taking advantage of Review Board. Our at-a-glance graphs will show you who is
pulling their weight, how thoroughly code is being reviewed, and more.

Plus, who doesn't like pretty pictures?


Review code stored on enterprise-level services
===============================================

Power Pack adds support for several source code management services for the
enterprise, helping you review your code whether managed online or in your
network.

The following services are currently supported by Power Pack:

* AWS CodeCommit
* Bitbucket Server
* GitHub Enterprise
* Team Foundation Server
* Visual Studio Team Services


Scale up your installation
==========================

Most Review Board installations work fine running on a single server, but some
very large installations with many thousands of users may require additional
hardware for speed or fault tolerance.

Power Pack includes facilities for storing auxiliary data like SSH keys in the
database rather than on the front-end server's filesystem, which allows you to
add capacity by spinning up additional servers as needed.


Getting Started
===============

Installation is easy. Just follow these steps:

1. Install Power Pack::

   $ pip install ReviewBoardPowerPack

2. Get a `trial license`_.

   After the trial expires, two users can continue to use Power Pack for
   free, forever.

3. If you're happy with Power Pack, `purchase a license`_ for as many or as
   few users as you need.

   Users only need a license if they're going to use Power Pack features.

   Support for Power Pack is included with a license.
