> [!Note]
> If PyTubeFix failed to connect to YouTube, it may need to be upgraded to the newest version.
>
> Using `pip`: `pip install --upgrade pytubefix`.
>
> Or using `uv`: `uv install --upgrade --reinstall youtube-downloader-cli`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD028 -->

## Dependencies

1. For CLI Application

   - pyperclip
   - pytubefix
   - questionary
   - rich

2. Of `pytubefix`
   NodeJS is used for POTOKEN generation by `pytubefix`. If NodeJS is not available, POTOKEN will be skipped, may result in YouTube denying `pytubefix`'s requests.

3. FFMPEG

   Progressive stream (both audio & video in one file) in YouTube has lower resolution. If `ffmpeg` is available, high resolution video & audio will be downloaded separately, then merges using `ffmpeg`.

   If `ffmpeg` is not available in $PATH, progressive stream will be downloaded.
