### The open-source library for Quantum Reinforcement Learning  
 

---

**QRL-QAI** is a Python framework built to serve as a central platform for everything **quantum reinforcement learning**.  
Built on top of **Gymnasium**, **PennyLane**, and **PyTorch**, this package provides the tools you need to explore and develop Quantum AI.
