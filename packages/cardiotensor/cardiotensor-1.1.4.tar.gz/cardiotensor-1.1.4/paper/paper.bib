              Background Current clinical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI provide resolution adequate to diagnose cardiovascular diseases but cannot depict detailed structural features in the heart across length scales. Hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) uses fourth-generation synchrotron sources with improved x-ray brilliance and high energies to provide micron-resolution imaging of intact adult organs with unprecedented detail. Purpose To evaluate the capability of HiP-CT to depict the macro- to microanatomy of structurally normal and abnormal adult human hearts ex vivo. Materials and Methods Between February 2021 and September 2023, two adult human donor hearts were obtained, fixed in formalin, and prepared using a mixture of crushed agar in a 70\% ethanol solution. One heart was from a 63-year-old White male without known cardiac disease, and the other was from an 87-year-old White female with a history of multiple known cardiovascular pathologies including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Nondestructive ex vivo imaging of these hearts without exogenous contrast agent was performed using HiP-CT at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Results HiP-CT demonstrated the capacity for high-spatial-resolution, multiscale cardiac imaging ex vivo, revealing histologic-level detail of the myocardium, valves, coronary arteries, and cardiac conduction system across length scales. Virtual sectioning of the cardiac conduction system provided information on fatty infiltration, vascular supply, and pathways between the cardiac nodes and adjacent structures. HiP-CT achieved resolutions ranging from gross (isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm) to microscopic (approximately 6.4-µm voxel size) to cellular (approximately 2.3-µm voxel size) in scale. The potential for quantitative assessment of features in health and disease was demonstrated. Conclusion HiP-CT provided high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional images of structurally normal and diseased ex vivo adult human hearts. Whole-heart image volumes were obtained with isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm, and local regions of interest were obtained with resolution down to 2.3–6.4 µm without the need for sectioning, destructive techniques, or exogenous contrast agents.

	abstract = {Diffusion MRI provides unique information on the structure, organization, and integrity of the myocardium without the need for exogenous contrast agents. Diffusion MRI in the heart, however, has proven technically challenging because of the intrinsic non‐rigid deformation during the cardiac cycle, displacement of the myocardium due to respiratory motion, signal inhomogeneity within the thorax, and short transverse relaxation times. Recently developed accelerated diffusion‐weighted MR acquisition sequences combined with advanced post‐processing techniques have improved the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion MRI in the myocardium. In this review, we describe the solutions and approaches that have been developed to enable diffusion MRI of the heart
              in vivo
              , including a dual‐gated stimulated echo approach, a velocity‐ (
              M
              1
              ) or an acceleration‐ (
              M
              2
              ) compensated pulsed gradient spin echo approach, and the use of principal component analysis filtering. The structure of the myocardium and the application of these techniques in ischemic heart disease are also briefly reviewed. The advent of clinical MR systems with stronger gradients will likely facilitate the translation of cardiac diffusion MRI into clinical use. The addition of diffusion MRI to the well‐established set of cardiovascular imaging techniques should lead to new and complementary approaches for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with heart disease. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {The mammalian heart, which is one of the first organs to form and function during embryogenesis, develops from a simple tube into a complex organ able to efficiently pump blood towards the rest of the body. The progressive growth of the compact myocardium during embryonic development is accompanied by changes in its structural complexity and organisation. However, how myocardial myoarchitecture develops during embryogenesis remain poorly understood. To date, analysis of heart development has focused mainly on qualitative descriptions using selected 2D histological sections. High resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) is a novel microscopic imaging technique that enables to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional images of the heart and perform detailed quantitative analyses of heart development. In this work, we performed a detailed characterization of the development of myocardial architecture in wildtype mice, from E14.5 to E18.5, by means of structure tensor analysis applied to HREM images of the heart. Our results shows that even at E14.5, myocytes are already aligned, showing a gradual change in their helical angle from positive angulation in the endocardium towards negative angulation in the epicardium. Moreover, there is gradual increase in the degree of myocardial organisation concomitant with myocardial growth. However, the development of the myoarchitecture is heterogeneous showing regional differences between ventricles, ventricular walls as well as between myocardial layers, with different growth patterning between the endocardium and epicardium. We also found that the percentage of circumferentially arranged myocytes within the LV significantly increases with gestational age. Finally, we found that fractional anisotropy (FA) within the LV gradually increases with gestational age, while the FA within RV remains unchanged.},

              Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) affect the myocardium and vasculature, inducing remodelling of the heart from cellular to whole organ level. To assess their impact at micro and macroscopic level, multi-resolution imaging techniques that provide high quality images without sample alteration and in 3D are necessary: requirements not fulfilled by most of current methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the non-destructive time-efficient 3D multiscale capabilities of synchrotron Propagation-based X-Ray Phase Contrast Imaging (PB-X-PCI) to study a wide range of cardiac tissue characteristics in one healthy and three different diseased rat models. With a dedicated image processing pipeline, PB-X-PCI images are analysed in order to show its capability to assess different cardiac tissue components at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The presented technique evaluates in detail the overall cardiac morphology, myocyte aggregate orientation, vasculature changes, fibrosis formation and nearly single cell arrangement. Our results agree with conventional histology and literature. This study demonstrates that synchrotron PB-X-PCI, combined with image processing tools, is a powerful technique for multi-resolution structural investigation of the heart
              ex-vivo
              . Therefore, the proposed approach can improve the understanding of the multiscale remodelling processes occurring in CVDs, and the comprehensive and fast assessment of future interventional approaches.},
