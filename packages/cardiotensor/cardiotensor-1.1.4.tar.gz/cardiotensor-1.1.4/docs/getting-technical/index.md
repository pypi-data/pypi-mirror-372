# Getting Technical

This section provides a deeper understanding of how `cardiotensor` works, including coordinate systems, angle definitions, structure tensor theory, and tractography method. It is intended for advanced users and developers.

## Topics Covered

- [Conventions](./conventions.md)

- [Structure Tensor](./structure_tensor.md): Mathematical background on the structure tensor and eigen decomposition

- [Angle Definitions](./angles.md): Detailed explanation of helix and intrusion angles

- [Fractional Anisotropy](./fractional_anisotropy.md)

- [Tractography](./tractography.md)
