# Conventions

## Sign conventions

Cardiotensor processes full-field orientation data in 3D volumes. Consistent with NumPy matrix indexing, the position (0, 0, 0) refers to the corner at the top-left of the first slice.

This convention is maintained across all processing pipelines, including structure tensor calculation and streamline generation.

## Orientation fields and eigenvectors

Eigenvector maps are saved in the shape `(3, Z, Y, X)`:

- 3 = x, y, z vector components
- Each voxel contains the orientation of the 3rd eigenvector (principal myocyte axis)

These vector fields are used for computing helix/intrusion angles, streamlines, and for visualization.


## Units of measurement

- Lengths are expressed in **pixels** (or voxels for 3D).
- Angles (helix, intrusion) are in **degrees**.
- Fractional anisotropy is **dimensionless**, ranging from 0 (isotropic) to 1 (highly anisotropic).


## Image format

All image volumes and masks must be provided as image stack files in formats such as `TIFF`, `JP2`, `PNG`, or as single RAW file (`MHD`).

Internally, images are processed as NumPy arrays:
```python
volume.shape == (Z, Y, X)
```

The same format is used throughout the orientation pipeline.
