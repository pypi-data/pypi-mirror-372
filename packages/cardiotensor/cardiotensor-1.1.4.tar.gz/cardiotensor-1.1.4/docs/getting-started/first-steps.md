# Verify the installation

After installing cardiotensor, you can verify that cardiotensor is installed correctly by running the command:

  ```console
  $ cardio-tensor --help
  usage: cardio-tensor [-h] [--start_index START_INDEX]
                    [--end_index END_INDEX] [--gpu]
                    [conf_file_path]

  This script computes orientation for a 3D volume based on the provided configuration file.
