## Introduction

**Cardiotensor** is a user-friendly and memory-efficient toolkit designed for analyzing the orientation of cardiomyocyte fibers in large heart imaging datasets. It uses advanced image processing techniques to help researchers to accurately quantify 3D cardiomyocyte orientations with high efficiency.



## Installation

cardiotensor is published as a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/cardiotensor/) and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/). Open up a terminal and install
cardiotensor with:

```bash
pip install cardiotensor
```

⚠️ Require python 3.10 or newer


## Documentation

cardiotensor's documentation is available at [josephbrunet.fr/cardiotensor/](https://www.josephbrunet.fr/cardiotensor/)

## Getting Started

Have a look at our [simple example](https://www.josephbrunet.fr/cardiotensor/getting-started/examples/) that runs you through all the commands of the package

    <em>
        <strong>Overview of the <code>cardiotensor</code> pipeline for 3D cardiac orientation analysis and tractography.</strong>
        <strong>(a)</strong> Input data consist of a whole‑ or partial‑heart volume and, optionally, a binary mask to restrict analysis to myocardial tissue.
        <strong>(b)</strong> Local cardiomyocyte orientation is derived by 3D structure tensor computation and eigenvector decomposition.
        The third eigenvector (smallest eigenvalue) is visualized as arrows, color‑coded by helix angle (HA); inset shows a zoom of the ventricular septum highlighting transmural fiber rotation.
        <strong>(c)</strong> After transforming to a cylindrical coordinate system aligned with the left ventricle, voxel‑wise HA, transverse angle (TA), and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps are computed for quantitative analysis.
        <strong>(d)</strong> Streamline tractography generated from the eigenvector field reveals continuous cardiomyocyte bundles throughout the heart, color‑coded by HA.

## More Information

This package uses the [structure-tensor](https://github.com/Skielex/structure-tensor) package to calculate the structure tensor, extending its capabilities for cardiac imaging.
