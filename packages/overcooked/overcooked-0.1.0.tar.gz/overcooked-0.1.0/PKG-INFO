# DISCLAIMER
**This implementation is taken from [HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai)**. This repo has been forked to remove any algorithm implementation, upgrade dependencies (such as numpy>=2.0) and only keep the core environment. 
It implements the `marlenv` interface in addition to original `gymnasium` one.

## Introduction ü•ò

Overcooked-AI is a benchmark environment for fully cooperative human-AI task performance, based on the wildly popular video game [Overcooked](http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/).

The goal of the game is to deliver soups as fast as possible. Each soup requires placing up to 3 ingredients in a pot, waiting for the soup to cook, and then having an agent pick up the soup and delivering it. The agents should split up tasks on the fly and coordinate effectively in order to achieve high reward.

You can **try out the game [here](https://humancompatibleai.github.io/overcooked-demo/)** (playing with some previously trained DRL agents). To play with your own trained agents using this interface, or to collect more human-AI or human-human data, you can use the code [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/tree/master/src/overcooked_demo). You can find some human-human and human-AI gameplay data already collected [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/tree/master/src/human_aware_rl/static/human_data).

**NOTE + LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTORS:** DRL and BC implementations are now deprecated. We used to include code for training BC and PPO agents in the `human_aware_rl` directory. See [this issue](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/issues/162) for more details.

This benchmark was build in the context of a 2019 paper: *[On the Utility of Learning about Humans for Human-AI Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05789)*. Also see our [blog post](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/).

## Installation ‚òëÔ∏è
You can install the pre-compiled wheel file using pip or your favorite package manager.
```bash
pip install overcooked
```
Note that PyPI releases are stable but infrequent. For the most up-to-date development features, build from source. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install the package, so that you can use the provided lockfile to ensure no minimal package version issues.
