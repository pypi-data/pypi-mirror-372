# Intputlib

**Because typing `int(input())` everywhere is too mainstream.**

---

## What is this?

IntputLib is a tiny Python library that solves the age-old struggle of reading integers from the user without the headache. No more repeating:

```python
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

Over. And. Over. And over again.

---

## Installation

Just install it with pip (if only life were this easy):

```bash
pip install intputlib
```

---

## Usage

```python
from intputlib import intput

age = intput("Enter your age (or fake it, we won't judge): ")
print(f"You are {age} years old!")
```

### Features

- Reads an integer from user input.
- Keeps asking until you actually enter a number (yes, it’s like your mom nagging you to clean your room). 🏠
- Saves you from the eternal curse of `ValueError`. 💀

---

## Why use this?

Because `int(input())` is a pain, and life is too short for repetitive error handling. Just use `intput()` and pretend Python is doing all the heavy lifting for you.
