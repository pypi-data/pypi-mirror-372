and identifying Chinese and English characters and punctuation.

def modified_levenshtein_distance(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the modified Levenshtein distance between two strings.
    The modified Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character \
    edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions, or swaps) required to change \
    one word into the other.
    The difference between the modified Levenshtein distance and the original \
    Levenshtein distance is that the modified Levenshtein distance allows for \
    swapping two adjacent characters.

        s2 (str): The second string.

    Examples:
        >>> modified_levenshtein_distance("abc", "abcc")  # 1
        >>> modified_levenshtein_distance("abc", "acb")  # 1
