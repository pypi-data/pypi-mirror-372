    A neural network model for language detection.
    This model is implemented using PyTorch's `nn.Module` and consists of a 
    sequential stack of fully connected layers with ReLU activations, dropout 
    for regularization, and a final softmax layer for classification.
    Attributes:
        model (nn.Sequential): The sequential model containing the layers of 
            the neural network.
    Args:
        input_shape (int): The size of the input features.
        num_classes (int): The number of output classes for classification.
    Methods:
        forward(x):
            Performs a forward pass through the model.
            Args:
                x (torch.Tensor): The input tensor.
            Returns:
                torch.Tensor: The output tensor after passing through the model.
