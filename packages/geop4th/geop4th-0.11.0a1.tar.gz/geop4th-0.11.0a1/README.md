## Presentation
**GEOP4TH** /ʤiɒpɑːθ/ jee-uh-pa-th (for GEOspatial Python Pre-Processing Platform for Trajectories in Hydro-socio-ecosystems) is a collection of generic, 
format-agnostic, python tools (*geobricks*) designed to easily standardize, manipulate and visualize space-time data. 

Besides, these *geobricks* are designed to be assembled into complete pre-processing workflows for specific data or to specific models. 
Such workflows can be collaboratively developped and shared within GEOP4TH. 
So far, GEOP4TH includes the workflows for pre-processing some of the most common French datasets ([SIM2](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-changement-climatique-sim-quotidienne/), 
[DRIAS/EXPLORE2](https://www.drias-climat.fr), [BNPE](https://bnpe.eaufrance.fr), [IGN](https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdalti)...), as
well as the workflows to format inputs for [CWatM](https://cwatm.iiasa.ac.at). Collaborative developments are welcome :)

In the end, GEOP4TH intends to help working on hydro-socio-ecosystems trajectories and diagnostics.

## Documentation
The most up-to-date documentation can be found online at:
- 📗 Documentation : https://AlexandreCoche.gitlab.io/geop4th

> **Note**
> Additionnaly, this documentation can be accessed offline through the *public/index.html* [file](public/index.html) on the *doc* branch 

## Getting started

> **Note**  
> Latest quickstart instructions are described in the [Documentation](https://AlexandreCoche.gitlab.io/geop4th) with more details.

*GEOP4TH* works under Python >= 3.11. Once Python installed, *GEOP4TH* can be installed with
```bash
pip install geop4th
```

Then, the main modules can be imported in your IDE as follow:
```python
# Basics elements
from geop4th import (
    geobricks as geo,
    download_fr as dlfr,
    trajplot as tjp,
    )
	
# or complete workflows
from geop4th import (
    standardize_fr as stzfr,
    cwatm,
    )
```

Note that if you do not have any, you can install an IDE (for instance Spyder) with:
```bash
pip install spyder
```


### Docker image
A Docker image of 0.10.1 version is available here: https://hub.docker.com/r/alexandrecoche/geop4th.

## Support
alexandre.co@hotmail.fr, and specify **geop4th** in the email subject.

## Project status
Currently under developpement.

## Roadmap
- [ ] implement download and standardize functions for ERA5 data
- [x] document essential functions
- [ ] finish documenting all the functions
- [ ] implement logging everywhere and add a workflow log
- [ ] implement a comparison function
- [ ] generalize data paths in *trajplot* and document it
- [ ] for contributing, test and resolve the installation procedure with pip
- [ ] clean code (remove useless commented sections, merge `georef` from *standardize_fr.py* into other functions, restructure *SIM2_tools* and *advanced_visualization*...)

### Contribute
Please have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Installation requirements for contributors
If you want to install *GEOP4TH* for contributing, please refer to the online [Documentation](https://AlexandreCoche.gitlab.io/geop4th/contributing/contributing.html).

Nevertheless, here are some quick instructions:
To install the Python environment required to use this module, it is necessary to install an Anaconda distribution (such as [Miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/)).

> **Tip**  
> For a start, we also advise using a Git Management tool (such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download)).

#### Retrieve this remote git folder to a local machine
To clone this git folder using for example GitHub Desktop, you can:
1. Go to `File` > `Clone repository...` 
2. Got to `URL` tab and enter https://gitlab.com/AlexandreCoche/geop4th.git
	- the `local path` should end with *geop4th*

#### Python environment
GEOP4TH requires some common open-source python packages (xarray, rioxarray, rasterio, numpy, pandas, geopandas, shapely, fiona, pysheds, plotly, matplotlib).

Installing the python environment can be done for example with Miniconda. In the conda console (admin mode advised), enter:
```bash
# If geop4th has been cloned to another disk than C:, it is necessary to enter the name of the disk first
# d: (for example)
cd "path/to/geop4th/install"
conda env create -f environment.yml -n geoenv

```

#### Set up
Open conda prompt and activate environment:
```bash
conda activate geoenv
```

Install and open an IDE such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
conda install spyder -c conda-forge

spyder
```

### Authors and acknowledgment
This work has been created by Alexandre Kenshilik Coche, with the help of the following first contributors:
The design of the *trajplot* figures was conceived with the help of **Laurent Longuevergne**, **Elias Ganivet** and **Veronique Van Tilbeurgh**.  
Part of the functions to handle SIM2 data were conceived with the help of **Ronan Abhervé** and some code parts from **Loïc Duffar**'s [scripts](https://github.com/loicduffar).  
Packing functions were based on **James Hiebert**'s [work](http://james.hiebert.name/blog/work/2015/04/18/NetCDF-Scale-Factors.html).
**Alexandre Gauvain** shared insightful ideas on how to structure the gitlab and the ReadTheDocs documentation.
**Bastien Boivin** and **Pape Saara Ngom** provided helpful advice to improve the installation procedure.
**Damien Belvèze** and **Martin Komlavi Amouzou** brought a significant help and crucial advice on software development good practices, replicability, testing and containerization.
Programmer web communities brought a considerable help to this work.
