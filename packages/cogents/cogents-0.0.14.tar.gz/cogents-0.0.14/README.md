A collection of essential, high-quality building blocks for constructing sophisticated multi-agent systems (MAS), with a primary focus on LangGraph. Not a full agentic framework, but a lightweight repository of key components to help bridge the last mile in MAS development.

For the underlying philosophy, refer to my this talk on MAS ([link](https://github.com/caesar0301/mas-talk-2508/blob/master/mas-talk-xmingc.pdf)).
