Introduction
------------

The `deployment` package allows creating a deployment of any Intel® Geti™ project.
A project deployment can run inference on an image or video frame locally, i.e.
without any connection to the Intel® Geti™ server.

Deployments can be created for both single task and task chain projects alike, the API
is the same in both cases.

Creating a deployment for a project is done through the
:py:class:`~geti_sdk.geti.Geti` class, which provides a
convenience method :py:meth:`~geti_sdk.geti.Geti.deploy_project`.

The following code snippet shows:

 #. How to create a deployment for a project
 #. How to use it to run local inference for an image
 #. How to save the deployment to disk

.. code-block:: python

   import cv2

   from geti_sdk import Geti

   geti = Geti(
     host="https://0.0.0.0", username="dummy_user", password="dummy_password"
   )

   # Download the model data and create a `Deployment`
   deployment = geti.deploy_project(project_name="dummy_project")

   # Load the inference models for all tasks in the project, for CPU inference
   deployment.load_inference_models(device='CPU')

   # Run inference
   dummy_image = cv2.imread('dummy_image.png')
   dummy_image = cv2.cvtColor(dummy_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
   prediction = deployment.infer(image=dummy_image)

   # Save the deployment to disk
   deployment.save(path_to_folder="deployment_dummy_project")

A saved Deployment can be loaded from its containing folder using the
:py:meth:`~geti_sdk.deployment.deployment.Deployment.from_folder` method, like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from geti_sdk.deployment import Deployment

   local_deployment = Deployment.from_folder("deployment_dummy_project")
